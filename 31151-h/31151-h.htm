<p><i>The work here presented to English readers was
published in French three years ago in an abbreviated
form. Worthy of attention as are the older
novelists of Great Britain, it was not to be expected
that details about Chettle, Munday, Ford, or Crowne,
would prove very acceptable south of the Channel,
especially when it is remembered that the history of
French fiction, not an insignificant one, from "Aucassin"
to "Jehan de Saintr&eacute;," to "Gargantua," and to
"Astr&eacute;e," still remains to be written. A compressed
account of the subject, amounting to scarcely more
than a hundred pages of the present volume, was
therefore deemed sufficient to satisfy such craving as
there was for information concerning Nash, Greene,
Lodge, and the more important among their peers.
According to the publishers of the book this estimate
was not fallacious, and there were no complaints of
omission.</i></p>

<p><i>When the honour of a translation was proposed for
the small volume, it appeared that a more thorough</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><i>
account of the distant forefathers of the novelists of
to-day would perhaps be acceptable in England; for
here the question was of countrymen and ancestors. The
work was for this reason entirely remodelled and rewritten
in order to furnish fuller particulars on our
authors' lives and works, and to extract from their
darksome place of retirement such forgotten heroes as
Zelauto, Sorares, Parismus, who had, some of them,
once upon a time, been known to fame, and had played
their part in the toilsome task of bringing the modern
English novel to shape.</i></p>

<p><i>In writing of Shakespeare's contemporaries, care has
been taken to enable the reader to judge them on their
own merits. With this view an effort has been made
to illustrate their spirit by what was best in their
books, and not necessarily what would recall the
master-dramatist's works, and would expose them to
the extreme danger of being dwarfed by him beyond
desert, and of fading away in his light as moths in
the sunshine. Considered from this standpoint, they will
not, however, cease to offer some degree of interest to the
Shakespearean student, for this process makes us aware
not merely of what materials Shakespeare happened to
use, but from what stores he chose them. On this
account such works as Greene's tales of real life have
been studied at some length, and a chapter has been
devoted to Nash, who, high as he stands among the
older novelists, has been allowed to pass unnoticed as
a tale writer by all historians of fiction. If, therefore,
a large use has been made of the publications of learned
societies devoted to the study of Shakespeare, liberal
recourse also has been had to the depositories of old</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><i>
original pamphlets, to the Bodleian library especially,
where, surprising as it may be in this age of reprints,
single copies of early novels, not to be met anywhere else,
are even now to be found. Some other writings of the
same kind, even less known, such as "Zelinda," a very
witty parody of a romantic tale by Voiture, the "Adventures
of Covent Garden," illustrative of the novel and
the drama in the seventeenth century, were found in
the primitive and only issue nearer at hand, in that
matchless granary of knowledge, whose name no student
can pronounce without a feeling of awe, because it is so
noble, and of gratitude, because it is so generously administered,
the British Museum.</i></p>

<p><i>Engravings have been added, for it seemed that
scattered as the rare originals of our tales remain, it
would be of assistance to gather together those curious
characteristics. They give an idea of the kind of
illustrations then in fashion, of the sort of appearance
some of our authors wore; they show how in the
course of centuries, Guy of Warwick was transformed
from an armour-clad knight into a plain squire with
a cane and a cocked hat; and they exemplify the way in
which foreign artists were in several cases imitated with
the burin, in the same books in which foreign literary
models were imitated with the pen. Objection having
been taken, in the very kindly criticisms passed upon
this work, to the absence of the only known representation
of Greene, this defect has been supplied in the
present edition.</i></p>

<p><i>I need not say that the translator of the portions
written originally in French took the trouble to overlook
my additions, and to revise my revisions. I need say</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><i>
that my heartiest thanks are due also to the well-known
Elizabethan scholar, Mr. A. H. Bullen, who, putting
aside for a while much more important work, has shown
me the great kindness of reading the proofs of this
volume.</i></p>

<tr><td class='thang'>21.&mdash;Frontispiece to Harington's translation of Ariosto, London, 1591,
fol. This engraving and the numerous copper-plates adorning this very fine
book are usually said to be English. But these plates were in fact a
product of Italian art, being the work of Girolamo Porro, of Padua; they
are to be found in the Italian edition of Ariosto published at Venice in
1588, and in various other editions. The English engraver, Thomas Coxon
(or Cockson), whose signature is to be seen at the bottom of the
frontispiece, only drew the portrait of Harington in the space filled in
the original by a figure of Peace. Coxon, according to the "Dictionary of
National Biography" and other authorities, is supposed to have flourished
from about 1609 to 1630 or 1636. The date on this plate (1st August,
1591), shows that he began to work nearly twenty years earlier.<br />

It must be added that this portrait of Harington has an Italian softness
and elegance, and differs greatly in its style from the other portraits
signed by Coxon (portrait of Samuel Daniel on the title-page of his Works,
1609; of John Taylor, "Workes," 1630, etc.). It is possible that
Harington's portrait was merely drawn by Coxon, and engraved by an

Dekker's "Horne-booke," 1609 (<i>infra</i>, ch. vi. &sect; 3). Spectators have not
been represented. They must be supposed to fill the pit, "planities sive
arena," where they remained standing in the open air, and the covered
galleries. The more important people were seated on the stage. Actors, to
perform their parts, came out of the two doors inscribed "mimorum &aelig;des."
The boxes above these doors, concerning which some doubts have been
expressed, seem to be what was called "the Lords' room." "Let our
gallant," says Dekker, "advance himself up to the throne of the stage. I
meane not the Lords roome (which is now but stages suburbs): no, those
boxes, by the iniquity of custome, conspiracy of waiting women and
gentlemen ushers, that there sweat together, and the covetousness of

<h1>The English Novel in the<br />
Time of Shakespeare.</h1>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The London publishers annually issue statistics
of the works that have appeared in England
during the year. Sometimes sermons and
books on theology reach the highest figures; England
is still the England of the Bible, the country that at
the time of the Reformation produced three hundred
and twenty-six editions of the Scriptures in less than
a century, and whose religious literature is so abundant
that to-day twenty-eight volumes of the British
Museum catalogue treat of the single word Bible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
When theology does not obtain the first rank, it holds
the second. The only writings that can compete with
it, in the country of Shakespeare, of Bacon and of
Newton, are neither dramas, nor books of philosophy
nor scientific treatises; they are novels. Theology had
the supremacy in 1885; novels obtained it in 1887,
1888, and 1889. Omitting stories written for children,
nine hundred and twenty-nine novels were published in
England in 1888, and one thousand and forty in 1889.
Thus the conscientious critic who wished to acquaint
himself with all of them would have to read more than
two novels and a half, often in three volumes, every
day all the year round, without stopping even on
Sundays.</p>

<p>This passion for the novel which does not exist
in the same degree in any other nation, only acquired
its full strength in England in the eighteenth
century. At that time English novels produced in
Europe the effect of a revelation; they were praised
extravagantly, they were copied, they were imitated,
and the popularity hitherto enjoyed by the "Princesse
de Cl&egrave;ves," "Marianne," and "Gil Blas," was
obscured for a while. "I say that Anglicism is gaining
on us," wrote d'Argenson; "after 'Gulliver' and
'Pamela,' here comes 'Tom Jones,' and they are
mad for him; who could have imagined eighty years
ago that the English would write novels and better
ones than ours? This nation pushes ahead by force of
unrestricted freedom."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Modern society had at length found the kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
literature which could be most suitably employed to
depict it. Society had been presented on the English
stage by the authors of domestic comedies; Steele and
Addison had painted it in their essays. But in both
forms the portrait was incomplete. The exigencies of
the stage, the necessary brevity of the essay, made it
impossible to give adequate expression to the infinite
complexity of the subject. The novel created anew by
Defoe, Fielding, and Richardson, made it an easy thing
to introduce into the arena of literature those men and
women of intelligence and feeling who, for long ages,
had been pleased to see other people the chief subjects
of books and inwardly desired that authors should at
last deal more especially with themselves. The age of
chivalry was gone; the time of the Arthurs and the
Tristans had passed away; such a society as the new
one could not so well be sung in verse; but it could
extremely well be described in prose.</p>

<p>As Fielding remarked, the novel takes the place
of the old epic. We think of the Harlowes when
in the olden time we should have dreamed of the
Atrid&aelig;. While man's attachment to science and
demonstrated truth is growing year by year, so,
simultaneously, the art of the historian and the art
of the novelist, both essentially empirical, become more
highly valued and more widely cultivated. As for the
lengthy tales devoted to Tristan and to "l'Empereur
magne," we know that their day is done, and we think
of them with all the pensive tenderness we cannot
help feeling for the dead, for the dim past, for a race
without posterity, for childhood's cherished and fast-fading
dreams. Thus in the same age when Clarissa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Harlowe and Tom Jones came to their kingdom, the
poets Chatterton, Percy, Beattie, and others, turned
back lovingly to the Middle Ages; and thus too the
new taste for history, arch&aelig;ology, and the painting
of real life, all put together and combined, ended by
producing a particular school of novel, the <i>romantic</i>
school, at whose head stands Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, something besides poetry is to
be sought for in these bygone epochs. Movements
of human thought have seldom that suddenness with
which they are sometimes credited; if those literary
innovations, apparently so spasmodic, are carefully and
closely studied, it will be nearly always found that the
way had been imperceptibly prepared for them through
the ages. We are in the habit of beginning the
history of the English novel with Defoe or Richardson;
but was there no work of the kind in England before
their time? had they to invent it all, matter and
method? It is not enough to say that the gift of
observation and analysis was inborn in the race, as
shown already, long before the eighteenth century, in
the work of the dramatists, moralists and philosophers.
Had not the same gift already manifested itself in the
novel?</p>

<p>The truth is that the novel shed its first splendour
during the age of Elizabeth; but the glory of
Shakespeare has overshadowed the multitude of the
lesser authors of his time, a multitude which included
the early novelists. While they lived, however, they
played no insignificant part; now they are so entirely
forgotten that it will perhaps be heard with some
surprise that they were prolific, numerous, and very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
popular. So great was the demand for this kind of
literature that some succeeded in making an income
out of their novels. Their books went through many
editions for that age, many more than the majority of
Shakespeare's plays. They were translated into French
at a time when even the name of the great dramatist
was entirely unknown to the French people. Lyly's
"Euphues," for example, went through five editions in
five years; in the same period "Hamlet" passed
through only three, and "Romeo and Juliet" through
two editions. Not a line of Shakespeare was put into
French before the eighteenth century, while prose
fictions by Nash, Greene, and Sidney were translated
more than a century earlier.</p>

<p>As in our own day, some of these novelists busied
themselves chiefly with the analysis of passion and
refined emotion; others chiefly concerned themselves
with minute observation of real life, and strove to
place before the reader the outward features of their
characters in a fashion impressive enough to enable him
to realize what lay below the surface. Many of these
pictures of manners and of society were considered by
contemporaries good likenesses, not the less so because
embellished. Thus, having served as models to the
novelists, the men and women of the day in their turn
took as example the copies that had been made from
them. They had had their portraits painted and then
tried hard to resemble their counterfeit presentments.
Lyly and Sidney embellished, according to the taste of
the age, the people around them, whom they chose as
patterns for the heroes of their novels; and as soon as
their books were spread over the country, fashionable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
ladies distinguished themselves from the common sort
by being "Arcadian" or "Euphuizd."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Thus through these very efforts, a literature, chiefly
intended for women, was arising in England, and this
is one characteristic more that links these authors to
our modern novelists. So that, perhaps, bonds, closer
than we imagine, unite those old writers lost in a far-off
past with the novelists whose books reprinted a
hundred times are to be found to-day on every reading-table
and in everybody's hands.</p>

<p>We make no pretence of covering in the present
volume this vast and little trodden field. To keep
within reasonable bounds we shall have to leave
altogether, or barely mention, the collections of
tales translated by Paynter, Whetstone and others
from the Italian or French, although they were
well known to Shakespeare, and provided him with
several of his plots. In spite of their charm, we
shall in like manner pass by the simple popular
prose tales, which were also very numerous, the
stories of Robin Hood, of Tom-a-Lincoln, of Friar
Bacon, however "merry and pleasant," they may be,
"not altogether unprofitable, nor any way hurtfull,
very fitte to passe away the tediousness of the long
winters evenings."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We intend to deal here chiefly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with those writers from whom our modern novelists
are legitimately descended. These descendants, improving
upon the early examples of their art left
by the Elizabethan novelists, have won for themselves
a lasting place in literature, and their works are among
the undisputed pleasures of our lives. Our gratitude
may rightly be extended from them to their progenitors.
We must be permitted, therefore, to go far
back in history, nearly as far as the Flood. The
journey is long, but we shall travel rapidly. It was,
moreover, the customary method of many novelists of
long ago to begin with the beginning of created things.
Let their example serve as our excuse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>BEFORE SHAKESPEARE.</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Minute research has been made, in every
country, into the origin of the drama. The
origin of the novel has rarely tempted the
literary arch&aelig;ologist. For a long time the novel
was regarded as literature of a lower order; down
almost to our time, critics scrupled to speak of it.
When M. Villemain in his course of lectures on the
eighteenth century came to Richardson, he experienced
some embarrassment, and it was not without oratorical
qualifications and certain bashful doubts that he dared
to announce lectures on "Clarissa Harlowe" and "Sir
Charles Grandison." He sought to justify himself on
the ground that it was necessary to track out a special
influence derived from England, "the influence of
imagination united to moral sentiment in eloquent
prose." But this neglect can be explained still better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
We can at need fix the exact period of the origin of
the drama. It is not the same with the novel. We
may go as far back as we please, yet we find the thin
ramifications of the novel, and we may say literally
that it is as old as the world itself. Like man himself,
was not the world rocked in the cradle of its childhood
to the accompaniment of stories and tales? Some
were boldly marvellous; others have been called historical;
but very often, in spite of the dignity of the
name, the "histories" were nothing but collections of
traditions, of legends, of fictions: a kind of novel. This
noble antiquity might doubtless have been invoked as a
further justification by M. Villemain and have confirmed
the reasons drawn from the "moral sentiment and eloquence"
of novels, reasons which were such as to
rather curtail the scope of his lectures.</p>

<p>In England as much and even more than with any
other modern nation, novelists can pride themselves
upon a long line of ancestors. They can, without
abusing the license permitted to genealogists, go back
to the time when the English did not inhabit England,
when London, like Paris, was peopled by latinised
Celts, and when the ancestors of the puritans sacrificed
to the god Thor. The novelists indeed can show that
the beginning of their history is lost in the abysm of
time. They can recall the fact that the Anglo-Saxons,
when they came to dwell in the island of Britain,
brought with them songs and legends, whence was
evolved the strange poem of "Beowulf,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the first epic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the most ancient history, and the oldest English romance.
In it, truth is mingled with fiction; besides the wonders
performed by the hero, a destroyer of monsters, we
find a great battle mentioned by Gregory of Tours,
where the Frenchmen, that were to be, cut to pieces
the Englishmen that were to be; the first act of that
bloody tragedy continued afterwards at Hastings, Cr&eacute;cy,
Agincourt, Fontenoy, and Waterloo.</p>

<p>The battle of Hastings which made England subject
to men from France resulted in a complete transformation
of the literature of the Teutonic inhabitants of
the island. Anglo-Saxon literature had had moments
of brilliance at the time of Alfred, and afterwards at
that of Saint Dunstan; then it had fallen into decay.
By careful search, accents of joy, though of strange
character, may be discovered in the texts which now
represent that ancient literature. Taking it as a whole,
however, this literature was sad; a cloud of melancholy
enveloped it, like those penetrating mists, observed by
Pytheas and the oldest travellers, which rose from the
marshes of the island and concealed the outlines of its
impenetrable forests. But the conquerors who came
from Normandy, from Brittany, from Anjou, from all
the provinces of France, were of a cheerful temperament;
they were happy: everything went well with
them. They brought with them the gaiety, the wit,
the sunshine of the south, uniting the spirit of the
Gascon with the tenacity of the Norman. Noisy and
great talkers, when once they became masters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
country, they straightway put an end to the already
dying literature of the conquered race and substituted
their own. God forbid that they should listen to the
lamentations of the Anglo-Saxon mariner or traveller!
They had no concern with their miserable dirges.
"Long live Christ who loves the French!"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Even in
the laws and religion of the French there now and then
appeared marks of their irrepressible <i>entrain</i>. Shall
we not, then, find it in their stories?</p>

<p>The new-comers liked tales of two kinds. First,
they delighted in stories of chivalry, where they found
marvellous exploits differing little from their own.
They had seen the son of Herleva, a tanner's daughter
of Falaise, win a kingdom in a battle, in course of which
the cares of a conqueror had not prevented him from
making jokes. When, therefore, they wrote a romance,
they might well attribute extraordinary adventures and
rare courage to Roland, Arthur and Lancelot: in face
of the behaviour of the bastard of Normandy, it would
be difficult to tax the exploits attributed to those
heroes with improbability. The numberless epic
romances in which they delighted had no resemblance
with the "Beowulf" of old. These stories were
no longer filled with mere deeds of valour, but also with
acts of courtesy; they were full of love and tenderness.
Even in the more Germanic of their poems, in "Roland,"
the hero is shaken by his emotions, and is to be seen
shedding tears. Far greater is the part allotted to the
gentler feelings in the epics of a subsequent date, in
those written for the English Queen Eleanor, by Benoit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
de Sainte More in the twelfth century, which tell for
the first time of the loves of Troilus and Cressida; in
those dedicated to Arthur and his knights, where the
favour of the mortal deities of whom the heroes are
enamoured, is responsible for more feats of chivalry
than is the search after the mysterious Grail.</p>

<p>They can take Constantinople, or destroy the Roman
armies; they can fight green giants and strange monsters,
besiege castles of steel, put traitors to death, and
escape even the evil practices of enchanters; but they
cannot conquer their passions. All the enemies they
have in common with Beowulf, be they men or armies,
monsters or sorcerers, they can fight and subdue; but
enemies unknown to the Gothic warrior oppose them
now more effectually than giants, stormy seas, or armed
battalions; enemies that are always present, that are
not to be destroyed in battle nor left behind in
flight: their own indomitable loves and desires. What
would the conqueror of Grendel have thought of such
descendants? One word in his story answers the question:
"Better it is," says he, "for every man, that he
avenge his friend than that he mourn much." This is
the nearest approach to tenderness discoverable in the
whole epic of "Beowulf."</p>

<p>In this contest between heroes differing so greatly
in their notion of the duties and possibilities of life
with whom do we side, we of to-day? With Beowulf
or with Lancelot? Which of the two has
survived? Which of them is nearest of kin to us?
Under various names and under very different conditions,
Lancelot still continues to live in our thoughts
and to play his part in our stories. We shall find him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the pages of Walter Scott; he is present in the
novels of George Eliot. For better or for worse, the
literature begun in England by the conquerors at the
battle of Hastings still reigns paramount.</p>

<p>Moreover, the new possessors of the English country
were fond of tales and short stories, either moving or
amusing, in which a word would make the reader laugh
or make him thoughtful; but where there was no
tirade, no declamation, no loud emphasis, no vague
speculation, a style of writing quite unknown to the
islanders and contrary to their genius. When they
returned of an evening to their huge and impregnable
castles, in perfect security and in good humour, they
liked to hear recited stories in prose, some of which are
still extant and will never be read without pleasure:
the story of Floire and Blanchefleur, for instance, or
perhaps, also that of Aucassin, who preferred "his
gentle love" to paradise even more unconcernedly
than the lover in the old song rejected the gift of
"Paris la grand ville;" of Aucassin, in whose adventures
the Almighty interposes, not in the manner of the
Jehovah of the Bible, but as "God who loveth lovers;"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and where Nicolete is so very beautiful that the touch
of her fair hands is enough to heal sick people. According
to the author the same wonder is performed by
the tale itself; it heals sorrow:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet the song, the story sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no man hearkens it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man living 'neath the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So outwearied, so foredone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick and woful, worn and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is healed, but is glad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis so sweet."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So speaks the author, and since his time the performance
of the same miracle has been the aim of the
many tale-writers of all countries; they have not all
of them failed.</p>

<p>The fusion of these two sorts of stories, the epic-romance
and the tale, produced long afterwards in
every country of Europe the novel as we know it now.
To the former, the novel owes more especially its
width of subject, its wealth of incident, its occasionally
dignified gait; to the second, its delicacy of observation,
its skill in expression of detail, its naturalness, its realism.
If we care to examine them closely, we shall
find in the greater number of those familiar tragi-comedies,
which are the novels of our own day,
discernible traces of their twofold and far-off origin.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The first result of the diffusion in England, after the
Conquest, of a new literature full of southern inventions
and gaieties, and loves, and follies, was the silencing of
the native singers. This silence lasted for a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
years; the very language seemed doomed to disappear.
What was the good of writing in English, when there
was hardly any one who cared to read it, and even those
few were learning French, and coming by degrees to
enjoy the new literature? But it turned out that the
native English writers had not been swept away for
ever. Their race, though silenced, was not extinct;
they were not dead, but only asleep.</p>

<p>The first to awake were the scholars, the men who
had studied in Paris. It was quite natural that they
should be less deeply impressed with nationalism than
the rest of their compatriots; learning had made them
cosmopolitan; they belonged less to England than to
the Latin country, and the Latin country had not
suffered from the Conquest. Numerous scholars of
English origin shone forth as authors from the twelfth
century onwards; among them Geoffrey of Monmouth,
of Arthurian fame, Joseph of Exeter, John of Salisbury,
Walter Map, Nigel Wireker, and many others of
European reputation.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century another awakening takes
place in the palace which the Norman enchanter had
doomed to a temporary sleep. Translators and imitators
set to work; the English language is again
employed; the storm has abated, and it has become
evident that there still remain people of English blood
and language for whom it is worth while to write.
Innumerable books are composed for them, that they
may learn, ignorant as they are of French or Latin,
what is the thought of the day. Robert Manning de
Brunne states, in the beginning of the fourteenth century,
that he writes:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not for the lerid bot for the lewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ffor tho that in this land wone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Latyn no Frankys cone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ffor to haf solace and gamen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In felawschip when thay sitt samen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are to enjoy this new literature in common, be
it religious, be it imaginative or historical; they will
discuss it and it will improve their minds; it will teach
them to pass judgments even on kings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And gude it is for many thynges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to here the dedis of kynges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilk were foles and whilk were wyse."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In their turn the English poets sang of Arthur; in
all good faith they adopted his glory as that of an
ancestor of their own. Among them a man like Layamon
accepted the French poet Wace for his model, and
in the beginning of the thirteenth century, devoted
thirty-two thousand lines to the Celtic hero; nor was
he ever disturbed by the thought that Arthur's British
victories might have possibly been English defeats.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Then came innumerable poems, translated or imitated
from French romances, on Charlemagne and Roland,
Gawain and the Green Knight, Bovon of Hanstone,
Percival, Havelock the Dane, King Horn, Guy of
Warwick, Alexander, Octavian, and the Trojan War.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Hundreds of manuscripts, some of them splendidly
illuminated, testify at the present day to the immense
popularity of these imitations of French originals, and
provide endless labour for the many learned societies
that in our century have undertaken to print them.</p>

<p>Layamon's indifference to the price paid by his compatriots
for Arthur's glory was not peculiar to himself.
It is characteristic of a policy of amalgamation deliberately
followed from the beginning by the Normans.
As soon as they were settled in the country they desired
to unify the traditions of the various races inhabiting
the great island, in the belief that this was a first and
necessary step towards uniting the races themselves.
Rarely was literature used for political purposes with
more cleverness and with more important results. The
conquerors set the example themselves, and from the
first adopted and treated all the heroic beings who had
won glory in or for England, and whose fame lingered
in ballads and popular songs, as if they had been personal
ancestors of their own. At the same time they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
induced the conquered race to adopt the theory that
mythic Trojans were their progenitors, a theory already
discovered and applied by the French to their own
early history, and about which fables were already
current among the Welsh people: both races were thus
connected together as lineal descendants, the one of
Brutus, the other of Francus; and an indissoluble link
united them to the classic nations of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> So it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
happened that in medi&aelig;val England French singers
were to be heard extolling the glory of Saxon kings,
while English singers told the deeds of Arthur, the
arch-enemy of their race. Nothing gives a better idea
of this extraordinary amalgamation of races and traditions
than a certain poem of the thirteenth century
written in French by a Norman monk of Westminster,
and dedicated to Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry
III., in which we read:</p>

<p>"In the world, I may confidently say, there never
was country, kingdom or empire, where so many good
kings, and holy too, were found, as in the English
island.... Saints they were, martyrs and confessors,
of whom several died for God; others most strong and
hardy, as were Arthur, Edmund, and Knut."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Rarely was the like seen in any literature; here is a
poem dedicated to a Frenchwoman by a Norman of England,
which begins with the praise of a Briton, a Saxon,
and a Dane. The same phenomenon is to be noticed,
after the Conquest in romances, chronicles and histories.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Whoever the author may be, whether of French
or English blood, the unity of origin of the two races
receives almost invariably the fullest acknowledgment;
the inhabitants of the great island cease to look towards
Germany, Denmark and Scandinavia, for their ancestors
or for the sources of their inspiration; they look rather,
like their new French companions, to Rome, Greece
and Troy. This policy produced not only momentous
social results, but also very important literary consequences;
the intellectual connection with the north
being cut off, the Anglo-French allowed themselves to
be drilled with the Latin discipline; the ancient models
ceased to appear to them heterogeneous; they studied
them in all good faith as the works of distant relations,
with such result that they, unlike the Germanic and
Scandinavian peoples, were ready, when the time of the
Renaissance came, to benefit by the great intellectual
movement set on foot by southern neo-classic nations;
and while Italy produced Ariosto and Tasso, while Spain
possessed Cervantes, and France Montaigne, Ronsard
and Rabelais, they were ready to give birth to the unparalleled
trio of Spenser, Bacon and Shakespeare.</p>

<p>From the fourteenth century this conclusion was easy
to foresee; for, even at that period, England took part
in a tentative Renaissance that preceded the great one
of the sixteenth century. At the time when Italy
produced Petrarca and Boccaccio, and France had
Froissart, England produced Chaucer, the greatest of
the four.</p>

<p>Famous as Chaucer was as a story-teller, it is strange
that he was to have almost no influence on the development
of the novel in England. When we read of Harry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Bailly and the Wife of Bath, of the modest Oxford
clerk and the good parson; when we turn the pages of
the inimitable story of Troilus and the fickle, tender,
charming Cressida, it seems as if nothing was lacking
to the production of perfect novels. All the elements
of the art are there complete: the delicate analysis of
passions, the stirring plot, the natural play of various
characters, the very human mixture of grossness and
tenderness, of love songs and rough jokes, the portraits
of actual beings belonging to real life and not to
dreamland. It was only necessary to break the
cadence of the verse and to write such stories in prose.
No one did it; no one tried to do it.</p>

<span class="caption">caxton&#39;s representation of chaucer&#39;s pilgrims, 1484.</span>
<p class='plno'>[<i>p.</i> 45.</p>
</div>

<p>The fact is the stranger if we remember that
Chaucer's popularity never flagged. It was at its
height in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; in the
following period the kings of literature, Dryden and
Pope, did homage to him. His works had been
amongst the first to be printed. Caxton's original
edition was quickly followed by a second.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The latter
was adorned with illustrations, and this rapid publication
of a second and amended text testifies to the great
reverence in which the author was held. Nevertheless
it is the fact that Chaucer stands alone; authors of
prose novels who wrote nearly two centuries after his
time, instead of trying to follow in his footsteps, sought
their models either in the old epic literature or in
French and Italian story-books. This is exactly what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Chaucer had done himself; but they did it with very
different success, and entirely missed the benefits of the
great advance made by him. By another strange
caprice of fate it was these sixteenth-century writers,
and not Chaucer, who were to be the ancestors of the
world-famous novelists of a later age, of the Richardsons
and Fieldings of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In one thing, then, the French conquerors entirely
failed; they never succeeded in acclimatizing during
the Middle Ages those shorter prose stories which
were so popular in their own country, in which they
themselves delighted and of which charming and sometimes
exquisite models have come to us from the twelfth
century downwards. When this art so thoroughly
French began, as we shall see, to be cultivated in
England, it was the outcome of the Renaissance, not
of the Conquest. Hundreds of volumes of medi&aelig;val
English manuscripts preserve plenty of sermons,
theological treatises, epic-romances, poems of all sorts;
but the student will not discover one single original
prose story to set by the side of the many examples
extant in French literature; nothing resembling the
French stories of the thirteenth century, so delightful
in their frank language, their brisk style and simple
grace, in which we find a foretaste of the prose of
Le Sage and Voltaire; nothing to be compared, even
at a distance, in the following century, with the narratives
of Froissart, who, it is true, applied to history his
genius for pure romance; nothing like the anecdotes
so well told by the Knight of La Tour Landry for
the instruction of his daughters; nothing that at all
approaches "Petit Jehan de Saintr&eacute;" or the "Cent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
nouvelles" in the fifteenth century. To find English
prose tales of the Middle Ages we should be forced
to look through the religious manuscripts where they
figure under the guise of examples for the reader's
edification. A very troublesome search it is, but not
always a vain one; some of these stories deserve to be
included among the most memorable legends of the
Middle Ages. To give an idea of them I will quote
the story of a scholar of Paris, after Caesarius, but
told in far better style by the holy hermit Rolle de
Hampole, in the fourteenth century. It is short and
little known:</p>

<p>"A scolere at Pares had done many full synnys the
whylke he had schame to schryfe hym of. At the
last gret sorowe of herte ouercome his schame, &amp;
when he was redy to schryfe till (to) the priore of the
abbay of Saynte Victor, swa mekill contricione was in
his herte, syghynge in his breste, sobbynge in his
throtte, that he moghte noghte brynge a worde furthe.
Thane the prioure said till hym: Gaa &amp; wrytte thy
synnes. He dyd swa, &amp; come a-gayne to the prioure
and gafe hym that he hade wretyn, ffor yitt he myghte

<p>But instances of this kind of story lack those
features of gaiety and satirical observation of which
French stories are full, and which are an important
element of the novel. Some are mystical; others, in
which the devil figures on whom the saints play rude
tricks, are intended to raise a loud laugh; in both
cases real life is equally distant. A keen faculty of
observation however existed in the nation; foibles of
human nature did not escape the English writer's eye
any more than its higher aspirations. This is illustrated
not only by Chaucer, who chose to write
poetry, but by such men as Nigel Wireker<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
Walter Map who chose to write Latin.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one English author before the Renaissance employed
such gifts in writing prose studies of real life in his
native tongue. Owing to the Conquest a certain
discredit seemed to rest for generations on England's
original language. Long after an English nation,
rich in every sort of glory had come into being, writers
are to be found hesitating to use the national idiom.
This circumstance is chiefly noticeable in prose where
the use of a foreign tongue offers less difficulties
than in poetry. Prose was less cultivated in England
even so late as the commencement of the sixteenth
century than in France during the thirteenth. At the
time of the Renaissance, Sir Thomas More, the wittiest
Englishman of his day, whose English style was
admirable and who moreover loved the language of
his native land, wishing to publish a romance of social
satire, the "Utopia,"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> wrote it in Latin. It is one of
the oldest examples in modern literature of that species
of book which includes at a later date the story of
Gargantua and Pantagruel, Bacon's "New Atlantis,"
Cyrano de Bergerac's "Etats et empires de la lune
et du soleil," F&eacute;nelon's "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque," "Gulliver's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Travels," Voltaire's tales, &amp;c. More's use of Latin
is to be the more regretted since his romance exhibits
infinite resources of spirit and animation; of all his
writings it is the one that best justifies his great reputation
for wit and enlightenment. His characters are living
men and their conversation undoubtedly resembles that
which delighted him in the society of his friend Erasmus.</p>

<p>The subject of the book is the quest for the best
possible government. More and his companions meet
at Antwerp one of the fellow voyagers of Amerigo
Vespucci the famous godfather of America, and they
question him concerning the civilizations he has seen.
"He likewise very willingly tolde us of the same.
But as for monsters, by cause they be no newes, of
them we were nothyng inquisitive. For nothyng is
more easye to bee founde, then bee barkynge Scyllaes,
ravenyng Celenes, &amp; Lestrigones devourers of people,
&amp; suche lyke great, &amp; incredible monsters. But to
find citisens ruled by good &amp; holsome lawes, that is
an exceding rare, &amp; harde thyng."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> By good luck
Amerigo's companion had discovered an empire which
presented this admirable quality: the island of Utopia,
or the country of "Nowhere." This country became
immediately famous all over Europe, so much so that
Pantagruel would not look to any other place for
immigrants to people his newly conquered kingdom
of Dispodie. There he transported "Utopians to
the number of 9,876,543,210 men," says Rabelais,
with his usual care for exact numbers, "without speaking
of women and little children." He did so to
"refresh, people, and adorn the said country otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
badly enough inhabited and desert in many places."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
His acting in this manner was only natural, for, as is
well known, connections existed between his family and
the Utopians, his own mother Badebec, the wife of
Gargantua, being "daughter to the king of the Amaurotes
in Utopia."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>A hundred years later, something of this want of
confidence in the future of English prose still lingered.
Bacon, after having employed it in his essays and
treatises, was seized with anxiety and kept in his pay
secretaries with whose help he meant to translate all his
works into Latin, in order to assure himself of their
permanence.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Some years before Sir Thomas More wrote his
"Utopia," an Englishman, who had long lived abroad
and had there learnt a new industry, unknown in his
own land, returned to England and settled in Westminster.
He and his trade were destined to exercise
a very important influence on the diffusion of literature,
and especially on the development of romances. His
art was printing, and his name was Caxton. We can
judge of the amazement he produced among his
countrymen by his new art, from his own wonder;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
one of his prefaces shows clearly enough how extraordinary
his performance seemed to himself: "And
for as moche, says he, as in the wrytyng of the same
my penne is worn, myn hande wery &amp; not stedfast,
myn eyen dimed with overmoche lokyng on the whit
paper &amp; my corage not so prone &amp; redy to laboure
as hit hath ben &amp; that age crepeth on me dayly
&amp; febleth all the bodye, &amp; also be cause I have
promysid to diverse gentilmen &amp; to my frendes to
addresse to hem as hastely as I myght this sayd book,
therfore I have practysed &amp; lerned at my grete
charge &amp; dispense to ordeyne this said book in
prynte after the maner &amp; forme as ye may here
see, &amp; is not wreton with penne &amp; ynke as other
bokes ben, to thende that every man may have them
attones, ffor all the bookes of this storye named the
recule of the historyes of troyes thus enpryntid as ye
here see were begonne in oon day &amp; also fynysshid in
oon day."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The list of his books shows that he was no less
intent upon diverting his customers than upon improving
their knowledge and morals. The part
allotted to fiction was extremely large, not perhaps
quite so extensive as that occupied by the novel
proper in the publishers' lists of to-day; but regarding
it as merely a beginning, it must be admitted to be
very promising. Not only did he print the tales of
Chaucer, the confessions of Gower, with their
numerous stories, several poems of Lydgate, a number
of medi&aelig;val epic romances in verse, but he also issued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from his press the prose story of "Reynard the Fox,"
which contains so much excellent dialogue and so many
fine scenes of comedy; and, besides, the most remarkable
prose romance that had yet been written in the
English language, the famous "Morte d'Arthur" of
Sir Thomas Malory. Its appearance marks an epoch
in the history of English romance literature.</p>

<p>Why, among so many famous works, should this publication
have obtained the preference and the attention
of the printer? Caxton states his reasons very clearly:
firstly, for him as for Layamon, Arthur is a national
hero, and Englishmen should be proud of him: then
again he is one of the nine worthies of the world.
These nine dignitaries were, as is well known, three
pagans, Hector, Alexander and C&aelig;sar; three Jews,
Joshua, David and Judas Maccab&aelig;us; three Christians,
Arthur, Charlemagne and Godfrey of Bouillon. And
lastly, Caxton considered his undertaking justified by
the great lessons that were to be drawn from Arthur's
example: "And I accordyng to my copye have doon
sette it in enprynte to the entente that noble men may
see &amp; lerne the noble actes chyvalrye the jentyl &amp;
vertuous dedes that somme knyghtes used in tho dayes
by whyche they came to honour &amp; how they that
were vycious were punysshed &amp; ofte put to shame
&amp; rebuke, humbly byseching al noble lordes &amp;
ladyes wyth al other estates of what estate or degree
they been of, that shal see &amp; rede in this sayd book
&amp; werke, that they take the good &amp; honest actes in
their remembraunce &amp; to folowe the same. Wherein
they shalle fynde many joyous &amp; playsaunt hystoryes
&amp; noble &amp; renomed actes of humanyte gentylnesse <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&amp;
chyualryes. For herein may be seen noble chyvalrye,
curtosye, humanyte, frendlynesse, hardynesse, love,
frendshyp, cowardyse, murdre, hate, vertue &amp; synne.
Doo after the good &amp; leve the evyl &amp; it shal brynge
you to good fame &amp; renommee."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Everything, in fact, is to be found in Malory's book;
everything, except those marks of character which
transform traditional types into living personalities;
everything except those analyses of feeling which are
for us the primary <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the modern novel
and its chief attraction. The old knight's book is a
vast compilation in which he has melted down and
mixed together a large number of tales about Arthur,
Lancelot, Gawain, Galahad, Percival, and all the
Knights of the Round Table. An infinite number
of short chapters, written in a clear and quiet style,
possessing no other charm than its simplicity, tell of
the loves and of the fights of these famous men; "of
theyr marvaylous enquestes and adventures," as Caxton
has it, "thachyevyng of the Sangraal, and in thende
the dolorous deth and departyng out of thys world of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
them al." Malory never made the slightest effort to
reach a grand style; he did not think that there could
be any other method of writing than that of putting
on paper, without preparation, what first came into his
mind. Since he possessed neither a passionate temperament
nor a wandering imagination, he tells, without
any apparent emotion, the most important of his
stories, even the last battle of his hero<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and his final
disappearance, when he is borne by fairies into the
Vale of Avilion. It is for sensitive hearts to weep
over these misfortunes, if they choose. As for him,
he goes on his way, telling tale after tale, in the same
clear and even voice; but very rarely giving us his
confidence or opening to us his heart.</p>

<p class='plno'>[<i>p.</i> 57.</p>
</div>

<p>Once in the whole length of this immense work he
does impart to us his personal opinion on a question
of importance: in the twenty-fifth chapter of his
eighteenth book, Malory confesses what he thinks of
love, and lays aside his usual reserve: and thus
furnishes the first attempt at analysis of feeling to be
found in the English prose romance. Malory declares
that every man should love God first and his mistress
afterwards; and so long as a man does love his God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
first, the other love seems to him to be not only
permissible but even commendable; it is a virtue.
"Therfore, as may moneth floreth &amp; floryssheth
in many gardyns, soo in lyke wyse, lete every man
of worship florysshe his herte in this world, fyrst unto
God &amp; next unto the joye of them that he promysed
his feythe unto: for there was never worshypful man
or worshipfull woman but they loved one better than
another ... &amp; suche love, I calle vertuous love."
But now-a-days, continues the old knight, little
suspecting that his grievance is one of all ages,
men cannot love seven-night but they must have
all their desires. The old love was not so. Men
and women could love together seven years, and no
wanton lusts were between them, and then was love
truth and faithfulness. "And loo," Malory adds
forgetting that his Lancelot and his Tristan waited
much less than seven years, "in lyke wyse was used
love in Kynge Arthurs dayes."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Very strikingly does this view of love contrast
with the southern irrepressible impetuosities of young
Aucassin, who, considering, three centuries earlier, this
same question of holy and profane love, of earth and
paradise, in the above-mentioned exquisite prose tale
which bears his name, simply alters the order of precedence
afterwards adopted by good Sir Thomas: "Tell
me," says he, "where is the place so high in all the
world that Nicolete, my sweet lady and love, would
not grace it well? If she were Empress of Constantinople
or of Germany, or Queen of France or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
England, it were little enough for her.... In Paradise
what have I to win? Therein I seek not to enter, but
only to have Nicolete my sweet lady that I love so
well.... For in Paradise go none but ... these
same old priests, and halt old men and maimed, who
all day and night cower continually before the altars,
and in the crypts.... These be they that go into
Paradise; with them have I naught to make. But into
Hell would I fain go; for into Hell fare the goodly
clerks and goodly knights that fall in tourneys and
great wars.... And thither pass the sweet ladies....
Thither goes the gold and the silver and cloth
of vair, and cloth of gris, and harpers and makers, and
the prince of this world. With these I would gladly
go, let me but have with me Nicolete my sweetest
lady."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>No one perceived the coldness of Malory's stories.
He wrote for a youthful and enthusiastic people; it
was a period of new birth throughout Europe, the
period of the spring-time of modern literature, the
epoch of the Renaissance. There was no need to
depict in realistic fashion the passions and stirrings of
the heart in order to excite the emotion of the reader;
a relation of events sufficed for him; his own imagination
did the rest, and enlivened the dull-painted canvas
with visions of every colour. The book had as much
success as Caxton could have expected; it was constantly
reprinted during the sixteenth century, and
enchanted the contemporaries of Surrey, of Elizabeth,
and of Shakespeare. It was in vain that the serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>-minded
Ascham condemned it; it survived his condemnation
as the popularity of Robin Hood survived
the sermons of Latimer. Vainly did Ascham denounce
"Certaine bookes of Chevalrie.... as one for
example, <i>Morte Arthure</i>: the whole pleasure of
whiche booke standeth in two speciall poyntes, in
open mans slaughter, &amp; bold bawdrye. In which
booke those be counted the noblest knightes, that do
kill most men without any quarell, &amp; commit fowlest
aduoulteres by sutlest shiftes."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>When the people became more thoughtful or more
exacting in the matter of analysis, they neglected the
old book. After 1634, two hundred years passed
without a reprint of it. In our time it has met
with an aftermath of success, not only among the
curious, but among a class of readers who are not
more exacting than Caxton's clients, and who are
far more interested in fact than in feeling. Children
form this class of readers; in the present century
Malory's book has been many times re-edited for them,
and it is to Sir Thomas Malory, rather than to
Tennyson, Swinburne or Morris, that many English
men and women of to-day owe their earliest acquaintance
with King Arthur and his Knights.</p>

<p>Caxton's example was followed by many; printing
presses multiplied, and with most of them fiction kept
its ground. A new life was infused into old legendary
heroes, and they began again, impelled not by the
genius of new writers, but simply by the printer's
skill, their never ending journeys over the world.
Their stories were published in England in small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
handy volumes, often of a very good appearance, and
embellished with woodcuts. There were prose stories
of "Robert the devyll," and there were verse stories
of "Sir Guy of Warwick" and of "Syr Eglamoure of
Artoys." Many of the cuts are extremely picturesque
and excellently suited to the general tone of the story.
On the title-page the hero of the tale usually sits
on his horse, and indomitable he looks with his
sword drawn, his plume full spread, his mien defiant.
A faithful squire sometimes follows him, sometimes
only his dog; between the feet of the horse fabulous
plants spread their unlikely leaves, and give the sole
and very doubtful clue to the country in which the
knight is travelling, certainly a very desolate and
unpleasant one. In this fashion does Duke Robert
of Normandy travel, and so does Eglamoure, and
Tryamoure, and Bevis, and Isumbras. In the same
series too is to be seen "Y<sup>e</sup> noble Helyas, Knyght of
the Swanne," drawn by the said swan, a somewhat
wooden bird, not very different from his successor
of a later age whom we are accustomed to see swimming
across the stage to the accompaniment of Wagner's
famous music.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The means by which English printers supplied themselves
with these engravings, is a mystery that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have kept to themselves. Many of the blocks were,
very probably, purchased in the Low Countries. A very
few are almost certainly of English manufacture, and
among them are Caxton's illustrations of the Canterbury
Tales: on this account we have given a fac-simile of the
most important of them, representing the pilgrims
seated round the table at the "Tabard" prior to
starting on their immortal journey. What is certain is
that many of these wood-block portraits of knights,
supplied to the printers by English or Dutch artists,
underwent many successive christenings. The same
knight, with the same squire, the same dog and the
same fabulous little wooden plants between the legs
of the horse was sometimes Romulus and sometimes
Robert of Normandy. In one book a rather fine engraving
of a lord and a lady in a garden, represents
Guy of Warwick courting "fayre Phelis,"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but in
another book the same engraving does duty for "La
bel Pucell" and the knight "Graund Amoure."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It
may be observed, in passing, that these romances might
be soundly criticized without much study of their contents
by simply inspecting their illustrations. Full as
they are of extraordinary inventions and adventures,
unrestricted as their authors were by considerations of
what was possible or real, some dozen well-chosen
engravings seem enough to illustrate any number of
them. For, alas, there is nothing more stale and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
subject to repetitions than these series of extraordinary
adventures; all their heroes are the same hero, and
whether he was following the philosophical turn of his
mind, or merely the thrifty orders of his printer, the
engraver was well justified in leaving as he did in most
of his drawings an empty scroll over the head of his
knights, for the publisher to label them at will, Robert
the Devil or Romulus.</p>

<p>We are thus fairly advanced into the sixteenth
century; the Renaissance has come; before long
Spenser will sing of the Fairy Queen and Shakespeare
will leave his native Stratford to present to a London
audience the loves of Juliet and Romeo. Scarcely any
sign of improvement appears yet in the art of novel-writing;
nothing but medi&aelig;val romances continue to
issue from the press; it is even difficult to foresee an
epoch in which something analogous to the actual novel
might be produced in England. Contrary to what was
taking place in France at the same time, that period
seemed far off. In reality, however, it was near at
hand; the great age of English literature, the age of
Elizabeth and of Shakespeare, was about to furnish,
at least in the rough draft, the first specimens of the
true novel.</p>

of Brutus the Trojan as father of the British race, as Nennius
had done two centuries earlier, did much for the spreading of
this belief; the popularity and authority of Geoffrey's fabulous
history was so great that for several centuries the gravest English
historians accepted his statements concerning Brutus without hesitation.
Matthew Paris, the most accurate and trustworthy historian
of the thirteenth century, gives an account of his coming
to the island of Albion, "that was then inhabited by nobody but a
few giants": "Erat tunc nomen insul&aelig; Albion, qu&aelig; a nemine,
exceptis paucis gigantibus habitabatur." Brutus proceeds to the
banks of the Thames, and there founds his capital, which he calls
the New Troy, Trojam novam, "qu&aelig; postea, per corruptionem
vocabuli Trinovantum dicta fuerit" ("Chronica Majora," Rolls
Series, I. pp. 21-22). In the fourteenth century Ralph, in his famous
"Polychronicon," gives exactly the same account of the deeds of
the Trojan prince, and they continued in the time of Shakespeare
to be <i>history</i>. Here is the learned account Holinshed gives of
these events in his "Chronicles":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hitherto have we spoken of the inhabitants of this Ile before
the coming of Brute, although some will needs have it that he was
the first which inhabited the same with his people descended of
the Troians, some few giants onelie excepted whom he utterlie
destroied, and left not one of them alive through the whole ile.
But as we shall not doubt of Brutes coming hither ..." &amp;c.</p>

<p>"This Brutus or Brytus (for this letter Y hath of ancient times
had the sounds both of V and I) ... was the sonne of Silvius, the
sonne of Ascanius, the sonne of Aeneas the Trojan, begotten of his
wife Creusa, and borne in Troie, before the citie was destroied"
(book ii. chap. i.).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>TUDOR TIMES, THE FASHIONS AND THE NOVEL.</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable effects of the Renaissance
was the awakening of a slumbering
curiosity. The <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of the Middle Ages was
just ended; its springs were exhausted, its mysteries
unveiled, its terrors ridiculed. Armour was beginning
to be thought troublesome; the towers of the strong
castles, dark and too much confined for the pleasures of
life; the reasonings of the schoolmen had grown old:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
blind faith was out of fashion; a world was ending,
and all that was sinking with it appeared in the eyes of
the young generation, out of season and "tedious as a
twice-told tale." The rupture between the Middle Ages
and modern times was complete in certain countries,
partial in others, and consequently the Renaissance had
very different results among the various peoples of
Europe. But the same characteristic symptoms of an
eager, newly awakened curiosity manifested itself in
all. There was no longer question of continuing, but
of comparing and of discovering. What did the ancient
Greeks and the old Romans say? What do our neighbours
think? What are their forms of style, their
recent inventions? England competed with France in
her youthful curiosity, and English poets and travellers
following the example of their rivals beyond the seas,
"plundered" (in the words of Joachim du Bellay's
famous manifesto<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>), not only Athens and Rome, but
Florence, Paris, Venice, and all the enlightened towns
of France, Italy, and Spain.</p>

<p>This curiosity spurred on the English in the different
paths of human knowledge and activity with an
audacity worthy of the Scandinavian Vikings. After
having destroyed the Armada, they were going to burn
the Spanish fleet at Cadiz, to discover new lands in
America and to give them the name of "Virginia" in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
honour of their queen, and to attempt the impossible
task of discovering a way to China through the icy
regions of the North Pole. The fine gentlemen and the
fine wits, even the lack-dinner, lack-penny Bohemians
of literature crossed the Channel, the Alps, and the
Pyrenees, seeking, they too, for gold mines to work,
gathering ideas, listening to stories, noting down recent
discoveries, and often appropriating the elegant vices
and the light morals of the southern nations. "An
italianized Englishman is a devil incarnate" is a
popular proverb which quiet home-keeping men were
never tired of repeating.</p>

<p>Kindly Ascham who had personally visited Italy,
had come back as much horrified with the sights he
had seen as Luther had been when he returned from
Rome. Of the masterpieces of art, of madonnas and
palaces he has little to say; but he has much to note
concerning the loose morals of the inhabitants. He
beseeches his compatriots not to continue to visit this
dangerous country: they will meet "Circe" there, and
will certainly greatly enjoy themselves; but, behold, they
will come back to their native land with an ass's head
and a swine's belly. In Italy, according to his experience,
a man may sin to his heart's content and no one
will in any way interfere. He is free to do so, "as it
is free in the citie of London to chose without all
blame, whether a man lust to weare shoo or pantocle."
Yet he speaks of what he has seen with his own eyes:
"I was once in Italie my selfe; but I thanke God my
abode there was but ix dayes. And yet I sawe in
that little tyme in one citie more libertie to sinne than
ever I heard tell of in our noble citie of London in ix<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
yeare ... The lord maior of London, being but a
civill officer, is commonlie for his tyme more diligent in
punishing sinne ... than all the bloodie inquisitors in
Italie be in seaven yeare."</p>

<p>When Englishmen come back from Italy they are
full of smiles; they have a ready wit, and delight in
vain talk. They give up all idea of getting married;
love and no marriage is their only wish; they arrange
assignations; they behave most improperly. "They
be the greatest makers of love, the daylie daliers, with
such pleasant wordes, with such smilyng &amp; secret
countenances, with such signes, tokens, wagers, purposed
to be lost before they were purposed to be
made, with bargaines of wearing colours, floures &amp;
herbes, to breede occasion of often meeting of him
&amp; her &amp; bolder talking of this &amp; that, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>According to some, travelling increased, in a certain
number of Englishmen, the tendency we have already
noticed, to feel contempt towards their mother tongue.
There are persons, wrote George Pettie in 1581, "who
will set light by my labours, because I write in English:
and those are some nice travailours who retourne home
with such queasie stomachs that nothing will downe with
them but French, Italian or Spanish ... They count
[our tongue] barren: they count it barbarous: they
count it unworthy to be accounted of." The more
reason, thinks Pettie, to try to polish it; if it is
barren it can be enriched by borrowing from other
languages, especially the Latin: "It is indeed the readie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
waie to inrich our tongue and make it copious; and it
is the waie which all tongues have taken to inrich themselves."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Pettie, as we see, wished Du Bellay's advice
to be followed, and Rome to be "plundered."</p>

<p>But Ascham's pleading, though many others spoke
to the same effect,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> had very little result. Learned
and well informed as he was, his "conservatism" in
all things was so intense that much might be laid to
the account of this tendency of his mind. Had he not
written that "his soul had such an horror of English
or Latin books containing new doctrines that, except
the psalter and the New Testament, this last, too, in
the Greek text, he had never taken any book, 'either
small or big,' to use Plato's words, concerning Christian
religion"?<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Had he not recommended the bow as,
even in those gunpowder times, the best weapon in
war? "If I were of authority, I would counsel all
the gentlemen and yeomen of England not to change
it with any other thing, how good soever it seems to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be; but that still, according to the old wont of
England, youths should use it for the most honest
pastime in peace, that men might handle it as a most
sure weapon in war."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The other "strong weapons"
must not lead men to forget this one: a thing they
have nevertheless done.</p>

<p>Nothing dismayed by the threat of the dire consequences
of Circe's wiles, travellers eager to see her
crowded to the south. They continued not to
"exchewe the way to Circes court, but go &amp; ryde
&amp; runne &amp; flie thether."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> No education was complete
without a sojourn on the continent. Surrey,
Wyatt, Sidney, penniless Robert Greene, and hundreds
if not thousands of others went there. There was an
eagerness to see and to learn that no sight and no
knowledge could satisfy, that no threat nor sermon
could stop. Paris, Venice, Rome, Vienna, the Low
Countries, received an ever-increasing flood of English
visitors.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>England in her turn, not to mention the classics
of antiquity that were being speedily translated, was
flooded with French, Spanish, and Italian books, again
to the great dismay of good Ascham. If "Morte
d'Arthur" was bad, nothing worse could well be
imagined than Italian books in general. "Ten
'Morte d'Arthures' do not the tenth part so much
harme as one of these bookes made in Italie and
translated in England." They are to be found "in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
every shop in London," and each of them can do
more mischief than ten sermons at St. Paul's Cross
can do good. They introduce into the land such
refinements in vice "as the single head of an Englishman
is not hable to invent."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>But, if unable to invent, the English seemed at least
determined to enjoy and imitate, for translating and
adapting went on at a marvellous pace. Boccaccio's
"Filocopo,"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> for instance, to speak only of the better

"Amorous Fiametta, wherein is sette downe a catalogue
of all and singular passions of love," in 1587;
his "Decameron" in 1620. Guazzo's "Civile Conversation"
was translated in 1586; Tasso's "Amynta"
in 1587, and his "Recoverie of Hierusalem" in 1594.
Castiglione's "Courtier ... very necessary and profitable
for young gentlemen abiding in court, palace
or place" was published in English in 1588. It was
"profitable" in a rather different sense from the one
Ascham would have given the word, for it contains
lengthy precepts concerning assignations and love-making:
"In my minde, the way which the courtier
ought to take, to make his love knowne to the woman,
me think should be to declare them in figures and
tokens more than in wordes. For assuredly there is
otherwhile a greater affection of love perceived in a
sigh, in a respect, in a feare, than in a thousand wordes.
Afterwarde, to make the eyes the trustie messengers
that may carrie the Ambassades of the hart."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Many
heroes in the English novels we shall have to study
were apparently well read in Castiglione's "Courtier."
Montemayor's Spanish "Diana," a tale of princes and
shepherds, well known to Sidney, was published in
1598. Ariosto's "Orlando furioso" appeared in 1591,
in a magnificently illustrated edition, and was dedicated
to the Queen. The engravings, though sometimes said
to be English, were in fact printed from the Italian
plates of Girolamo Porro, of Padua, and had been
used before in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Their circulation in England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
is none the less remarkable, and the influence such
a publication may have had in the diffusing of Italian
tastes in this country cannot be exaggerated. For
those who had not been able to leave their native
land, it was the best revelation yet placed before the
public of the art of the Renaissance. That it was
an important undertaking and a rather risky one,
the translator, John Harington, was well aware; for
he prefaced his book not only with his dedication
to the Queen, a sort of thing to which Ascham had
had great objection,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but by a "briefe apologie of
poetrie," especially of that of Ariosto. It must be
confessed that his arguments are far from convincing,
and it would have been much better to have left
the thing alone than to have defended the moral
purposes of his author by such observations as these:
"It may be and is by some objected that, although
he writes christianly in some places, yet in some
other, he is too lascivious.... Alas if this be a
fault pardon him this one fault; though I doubt too
many of you, gentle readers, wil be to exorable in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
point, yea me thinks I see some of you searching
already for those places of the booke and you are halfe
offended that I have not made some directions that you
might finde out and reade them immediately. But I
beseech you ... to read them as my author ment
them, to breed detestation and not delectation," &amp;c.
And he then appends to his book a table, by means
of which the gentle readers will have no trouble in
finding the objectionable passages enumerated in the
"Apologie" itself.</p>

<p>At the same time as translations proper, many
imitations were published, especially imitations of
those shorter prose stories which were so numerous
on the continent, and which had never been properly
acclimatized in England during the Middle Ages. Their
introduction into this country had a great influence on
the further development of the novel; their success
showed that there was a public for such literature;
hence the writing of original tales of this sort in
English. Among collections of foreign tales translated
or imitated may be quoted Paynter's "Palace
of Pleasure," 1566,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> containing histories from Boccaccio,
Bandello, Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, Straparole,
the Spaniard Guevara, the Queen of Navarre, "and
other italian and french authours." One of them is
the history of "Rhomeo and Iulietta," from which
Shakespeare derived his immortal drama; another tale
in the same collection supplied the plot of "All's
Well," and another the main events of "Measure for
Measure." Then came G. Fenton's "Tragicall Discourses,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>1567, finished at Paris and published by the
author as the first-fruits of his travels; T. Fortescue's
"Foreste or collection of histories ... done out of
French," 1571; George Pettie's "Pettie Pallace of
Pettie his pleasure," 1576; Robert Smyth's "Straunge
and tragicall histories translated out of french," 1577;
Barnabe Rich's "Farewell to militarie profession,"
1584, where Shakespeare found the plot of "Twelfth
Night"; G. Whetstone's "Heptameron of civill
discourses," 1582; Ed. Grimeston's translation of the
"Admirable and memorable histories" of Goulart,
1607, and several others.</p>

<p>Besides such collections many stories were separately
translated and widely circulated. A number have been
lost, but some remain, such, for instance, as "The adventures
passed by Master F. I.," adapted by Gascoigne
from the Italian,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> or a certain "Hystorie of Hamblet,"
1608,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which was destined to have great importance
in English literature, or the "Goodli history of the
... Ladye Lucres of Scene in Tuskane and of her
lover Eurialus," a translation from the Latin of &AElig;neas
Sylvius Piccolomini, and one of the most popular novels
of the time. It went through twenty-three editions in
the fifteenth century, and was eight times translated,
one of the French translations being made "&agrave; la pri&egrave;re
et requeste des dames." A German translation by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Nicolaus von Wyle is embellished with coloured woodcuts
of the most na&iuml;ve and amusing description. Three
English translations were published, one before 1550,
another in 1669, and a third in 1741.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<span class="caption">the knight eurialus getting secretly into his lady-love&#39;s
chamber, 1477.</span>
</div>

<p>It is a tale of unlawful love, and tells how Lucrece
a married lady of Sienna, fell in love with Eurialus,
a knight of the court of the Emperor Sigismond.
It is, we are told, a story of real life under fictitious
names. The dialogue is easy, vigorous, and passionate,
and the translator has well succeeded in transmuting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
these qualities into his yet unbroken mother tongue.
Here, for instance, Lucrece is discussing with the
faithful Zosias the subject of her love.</p>

<p>"Houlde thy peace quod Lucrece, there is no feare
at all. Nothynge he feareth that feareth not death ...</p>

<p>"Oh! unhappie quod Zosias, thou shalt shame thy
house, and onlye of all thy kynne thou shalte be adulteresse.
Thinkest thou the deede can be secreate? A
thousand eyne are about thee. Thy mother, if shee do
accordinge, shall not suffer thy outrage to be prevye,
not thy husbande, not thy cousyns, not thy maidens,
ye, and thoughe thy servauntes woulde holde theyr
peace, the bestes would speake it, y<sup>e</sup> dogges, the poostes
and the marble stones, and thoughe thou hyde all, thou
canste not hyde it from God that seeth all ...</p>

<p>"I knowe quod she it is accordinge as thou sayest,
but the rage maketh me folow the worse. My mynde
knoweth howe I fall hedling, but furour hath overcom
and reygneth, and over all my thought ruleth love. I
am determined to folow the commandement of love.
Overmuche alas have I wrestled in vaine; if thou have
pytie on me, carye my mesage."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>If the German translation was adorned with woodcuts,
the English text had an embellishment of a greater
value; it consisted in the conclusion of the tale as
altered by the English writer. In the Latin original
of the future pope, Pius II., Lucrece dies, and
Eurialus, having followed the Emperor back to
Germany, mourns for her "till the time when C&aelig;sar
married him to a virgin of a ducal house not less
beautiful than chaste and wise," a very commonplace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
way of mourning for a dead mistress. This seemed
insufferable to the English translator. Faithful as he
is throughout, he would not take upon himself to
alter actual facts, yet he thought right to give a
different account of his hero's feelings: "But lyke as
he folowed the Emperoure so dyd Lucres folow hym
in hys sleep and suffred hym no nygtes rest, whom
when he knew hys true lover to be deed, meaved by
extreme dolour, clothed him in mournynge apparell,
and utterly excluded all comforte, and yet though the
Emperoure gave hym in mariage a ryghte noble and
excellente Ladye, yet he never enjoyed after, but in
conclusyon pitifully wasted his painful lyfe."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The greater the display of feeling in such tales of
Italian origin, the bitterer were the denunciations of
moral censors, and the greater at the same time their
popularity with the public. The quarrel did not abate
for one minute during the whole of the century; the
period is filled with condemnations of novels, dramas
and poems, answered by no less numerous apologies for
the same. The quarrel went on even beyond the
century, the adverse parties meeting with various
success as Cromwell ruled or Charles reigned; it can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
scarcely be said to have ever been entirely dropped, and
the very same arguments used by Ascham against the
Italian books of his time are daily resorted to against
the French books of our own age.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the Italian novels had the better of
it in Elizabethan times; they were found not only "in
every shop," but in every house; translations of them
were the daily reading of Shakespeare, and as they had
an immense influence not only in emancipating the
genius of the dramatists of the period, but, what was of
equal importance, in preparing an audience for them,
we may be permitted to look at them with a more
indulgent eye than the pre-Shakespearean moralists.</p>

<p>A curious list of books, belonging during this same
period (1575) to a man of the lower middle class, an
average member of a Shakespearean audience, has been
preserved for us. It is to be found in a very quaint
account of the Kenilworth festivities, sent by Robert
Laneham, a London mercer, to a brother mercer of the
same city. Laneham states how an acquaintance of
his, Captain Cox, a mason by trade, had in his possession,
not only "Kyng Arthurz book, Huon of
Burdeaus, The foour suns of Aymon, Bevis of
Hampton," and many of those popular romances, illustrated
with woodcuts of which a few specimens are to
be seen above, but also, mason as he was, the very
same Italian book, the "Lucres and Eurialus," of which
we have just given an account.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>With the diffusion of these small handy volumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of tales of all kinds, from all countries, a quite
modern sort of literature, a literature for travellers,
was being set on foot. Manuscript books did not
easily lend themselves to be carried about; but it
was otherwise with the printed pamphlets. Authors
began to recommend their productions as convenient
travelling companions, very much in the same manner
as the publishers recommend them now as suitable to
be taken to the Alps or to the seaside. Paynter, for
example, who circulated in England from the year
1566 his collection of tales translated or imitated from
Boccaccio and Bandello, Apuleius and Xenophon, the
Queen of Navarre, and Bonaventure Desperriers, Belleforest
and Froissart, Guevara and many others, assures
his reader that: "Pleasaunt they be for that they recreate,
and refreshe weried mindes defatigated either with
painefull travaile or with continuall care, occasioning
them to shunne and to avoid heavinesse of minde,
vaine fantasies and idle cogitations. Pleasaunt so well
abroad as at home, to avoide the griefe of winters
night and length of sommers day, which the travailers
on foote may use for a staye to ease their weried bodye,
and the journeours on horsback, for a chariot or lesse
painful meane of travaile in steade of a merie companion
to shorten the tedious toyle of wearie wayes."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It is pleasant to think of Shakespeare in some
journey from Stratford to London, sitting under a
tree, and in order to forget "the tedious toyle of
wearie wayes," taking out of his pocket Paynter's
book to dream of future Romeos and possible Helenas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The Italian and French languages were held in great
honour; both were taught at Oxford and Cambridge;
the latter especially was of common use in England,
and this peculiarity attracted the notice of foreigners.
"As regards their manners and mode of living, ornaments,
garments and vestments," writes the Greek
Nicander Nucius, in 1545, "they resemble the French
more than others, and, for the most part, they use
their language."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But besides these elegant languages,
Greek and Latin were becoming courtly. They were
taught in the schools and out of the schools; the
nobles, following the example of King Henry VIII.
and his children, made a parade of their knowledge.
Ignorance was no longer the fashion, no more than
the old towers without windows. The grave Erasmus
went to hear Colet, the Dean of St. Paul's, and "he
thought he was hearing Plato"; Sir T. More, according
to Erasmus, is the "sweetest, softest, happiest
genius nature has ever shaped." In a word, "literature
is triumphant among the English. The king himself,
the two cardinals, almost all the bishops, favour with
all their soul and adorn Letters."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> To learn Greek
and Latin was to move with the times and to follow
the fashion. "All men," says Ascham, less displeased
with this novelty than with the travelling propensities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of his compatriots, "covet to have their children speake
latin"; and "Sophocles and Euripides are more familiar
now here than Plautus was formerly."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Dazzled by what
he saw and heard, Erasmus was announcing to the world
in enthusiastic letters that "the golden age" was to be
born again in this fortunate island.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> His only regret
was that he would perhaps not live long enough to see
it. Well might he regret it, even though it were not
to follow exactly as he had foreseen; for the golden
apple of the golden age was not to be plucked in the
Greek Hesperides' garden, but in a plain Warwickshire
orchard: nor was it the less golden.</p>

<p>This fermentation of mind lasted for more than a
century; lives were often shortened by it, but they had
been doubly well filled. From this restless curiosity,
bent towards past ages and foreign countries, towards
everything that was remote, unknown and different,
came that striking appearance of omniscience and universality,
and that prodigious wealth of imagery, allusions
and ideas of every kind that are to be found in
all the authors of that time, small as well as great, and
which unites in one common bond Rabelais and Shakespeare,
Cervantes and Sidney and the "master of the
enchanters of the ear," Ronsard.</p>

<p>When the armour, worn less often, began to grow
rusty in the great halls, and the nobles, coming forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from their coats-of-mail like the butterfly from the
chrysalis, showed themselves all glistening in silk, pearls
in their ears, their heads full of Italian madrigals and
mythological similes, a new society was formed, salons
of a kind were organized, and the r&ocirc;le of the women
was enlarged. English medi&aelig;val times had been by no
means sparing of compliments to them. But there is a
great difference between celebrating in verse fair, slim-necked
ladies, and writing books expressly for them:
and it is one of the points in which, during the Middle
Ages and even until the middle of the sixteenth century,
England differed from the nations of the south. In
England no Lady Oisille had gathered round her in the
depth of green valleys tellers of amorous stories; no
thickly-shaded parks had seen Fiammettas or Philomenas
listening to all kinds of narratives, forgetful of the
actual world and its sorrows. The only group of
story-tellers, bound together by a true artist's fancy,
Chaucer's pilgrims, had ridden in broad daylight on
the high road to Canterbury, led by Harry Bailly, the
jovial innkeeper of Southwark, a blustering, red-faced
dictator, who had regulated the pace of the nags, and
silenced the tedious babblers: very different in all
things from Fiammetta and the Lady Oisille.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Italy, France and mythology,
the England of the Tudors, changed all that. Women
appeared in the foreground: a movement of general
curiosity animated the age, and they participated in it
quite naturally. They will become learned, if necessary,
rather than remain in the shade; they will no
longer rest contented with permission to read books
written for their fathers, brothers, lovers, or husbands;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
some must be written especially on their account,
consulting their preferences and personal caprices; and
they had good reason to command: one of them sat
on the throne.</p>

<p>They, too, began to read Greek, Latin, Italian and
French; knowledge was so much the fashion that it
extended to women. Here Ascham bears testimony
in their favour; the Queen herself gives the example:
"She readeth now at Windsore more Greeke every
day than some prebendarie of this chirch doth read
Latin in a wole weeke."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In this she has innumerable
imitators, so much so that Harrison sums up as follows
his judgment concerning English ladies: "To saie
how many gentlewomen and ladies there are, that
beside sound knowledge of the Greeke and Latin
toongs are thereto no lesse skilfull in the Spanish,
Italian and French or in some one of them, it resteth
not in me."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>It must not be believed, however, that so much
Greek and Latin in any way imperilled the grace and
ease of their manners, or that when you met them you
would be welcomed with a quotation from Plato and
dismissed with a verse from Virgil. Far from it. It
was the custom at that time with English ladies to
greet their friends and relations, and even strangers,
with kisses, and strange as it may appear to our
modern ideas, accustomed as we are to stare in amazement
at such practices when by any chance we observe
them in southern countries, the custom was so strikingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
prevalent in England that travellers noticed it as one of
the strange sights of the land; grave Erasmus cynically
calls it one of its attractions. "This custom," says
he, "will never be praised enough."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The above-named
Nicander Nucius, of Corcyra, who came to England
some fifty years later, notices the same habit as a
great local curiosity. According to him, the English
"display great simplicity and absence of jealousy in
their usages towards females. For not only do those
who are of the same family and household kiss them
... with salutations and embraces, but even those,
too, who have never seen them. And to themselves
this appears by no means indecent."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The very Queen
herself, even in the middle of the most imposing ceremonies,
could not help indulging in familiarities contrary
to our ideas of decorum, but quite in accordance with
the freedom of manners then prevalent. Sir James
Melville relates in his memoirs how he was present
when Robert Dudley was made "Earl of Leicester and
baron of Denbigh; which was done at Westminster
with great solemnity, the Queen herself helping to put
on his ceremonial, he sitting upon his knees before her
with a great gravity. But she could not refrain from
putting her hand in his neck, smilingly tickling him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the French Ambassadour and I standing by. Then
she turned, asking at me, 'how I liked him?'"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The earliest attempts at the novel in the modern
style bore a resemblance to these social and intellectual
manners. Let us not be surprised if these works
are too heavily bedizened for our liking: the toilettes
and fashions of that time were less sober than
those of to-day; it was the same with literature.
Queen Elizabeth, who was wholly representative of
her age, and shared even its follies, liked and encouraged
finery in everything. All that was ornament
and pageantry held her favour; in spite of public
affairs, she remained all her life the most feminine
of women; on her gowns, in her palaces, with her
poets, she liked to find ornaments and embellishments
in profusion. The learned queen who read
Plutarch in Greek, a thing Shakespeare could never
do, and translated Boetius into English,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> found, in
spite of her philosophy, an immense delight in having
herself painted in fantastic costumes, her thin person
hidden in a silken sheath, covered by a light gauze, over
which birds ran. Around her was a perpetual field of
cloth of gold, and the nobles sold their lands in order
to appear at Court sufficiently embroidered. She
liked nothing better than to hear and take part in
conversations on dresses and fashions. This was so
well known, that when Mary, Queen of Scots, sent
the same Sir James Melville on his mission to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
English Court, in 1564, she was careful to advise him
not to forget such means to propitiate her "dear sister."
The account left by Melville of the way in which he
carried into effect this part of his instructions is highly
characteristic of the times, and gives an idea of the way
in which a courtly conversation was then conducted:</p>

<p>"The Queen my mistress," says Melville, in his
"Memoires," "had instructed me to leave matters of
gravity sometimes, and cast in merry purposes, lest
otherwise I should be wearied [wearying], she being
well informed of that queens natural temper. Therefore
in declaring my observations of the customs of
Dutchland, Poland and Italy, the buskins of the women
was not forgot, and what countrey weed I thought best
becoming gentlewomen. The Queen said she had cloths
of every sort, which every day thereafter, so long as I
was there, she changed. One day she had the English
weed, another the French, and another the Italian and
so forth.</p>

<p>"She asked me which of them became her best?</p>

<p>"I answered, in my judgment the Italian dress,
which answer I found pleased her well, for she delighted
to shew her golden coloured hair, wearing a
caul and bonnet as they do in Italy. Her hair was more
reddish than yellow, curled in appearance naturally.</p>

<p>"She desired to know of me what colour of hair was
reputed best, and which of them two was fairest.</p>

<p>"I answered the fairness of them both was not their
worst faults.</p>

<p>"But she was earnest with me to declare which of
them I judged fairest?</p>

<p>"I said she was the fairest Queen of England, and
mine the fairest Queen of Scotland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet she appeared earnest.</p>

<p>"I answered they were both the fairest Ladies in
their countries; that Her Majesty was whiter, but my
Queen was very lovely.</p>

<p>"She inquired which of them was of highest stature?</p>

<p>"I said my Queen.</p>

<p>"Then saith she, she is too high, for I, my self, am
neither too high nor too low. Then she asked what
kind of exercise she used?</p>

<p>"I answered that when I received my dispatch, the
Queen was lately come from the High-land hunting.
That when her more serious affairs permitted, she was
taken up with reading of histories; that sometimes she
recreated her self in playing upon the lute and virginals.</p>

<p>"She asked if she played well? I said reasonably,
for a Queen.</p>

<p>"That same day after dinner my Lord of Hunsdean
drew me up to a quiet gallery, that I might hear
some musick, but he said that he durst not avow it,
where I might hear the Queen play upon the virginals.
After I had hearkned a while, I took up the tapistry
that hung before the door of the chamber, and seeing
her back was toward the door, I entered within the
chamber, and stood a pretty space hearing her play
excellently well, but she left off immediately, so soon
as she turned her about and saw me. She appeared to be
surprized to see me, and came forward, seeming to strike
me with her hand, alledging she used not to play before
men, but when she was solitary to shun melancholly."</p>

<p>Fortunately she does not strike the ambassador, and
is easily pacified. She wants to dazzle him also with
her knowledge of languages:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said my French was good, and asked if I could
speak Italian which she spoke reasonably well....
Then she spake to me in Dutch [<i>i.e.</i>, German], which
was not good; and would know what kind of books I
most delighted in, whether theology, history, or love
matters." She manages to keep Melville two days
longer than he had intended to stay "till I might see
her dance, as I was afterward informed. Which being
over, she inquired of me whether she or my Queen
danced best? I answered the Queen danced not so high
and disposedly as she did."</p>

<p>This woman, nevertheless, with so many frailties and
ultra-feminine vanities, was a sovereign with a will and
a purpose. Even in the midst of this talk about
buskins, love-books and virginals, it shone out. So
much so, that hearing she is resolved not to marry,
the Scottish ambassador immediately retorts in somewhat
blunt fashion: "I know the truth of that,
madam, said I, and you need not tell it me. Your
Majesty thinks if you were married, you would be
but Queen of England, and now you are both King
and Queen. I know your spirit cannot endure a
commander."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The same singular combination may be observed in
the literary works of her time: flowers of speech and
vanities abound, but they are not without an aim.
Rarely was any sovereign so completely emblematic of
his or her period. She may almost be said to be the
key to it; and it may be very well asserted that whatever
the branch of art or literature of this epoch you
wish to understand, you must first study Elizabeth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Her taste for finery and jewels remained to the last.
Hentzner, a German, who saw her many years after
Melville, describes her coming out of her chapel at
Greenwich Palace, in 1598. She has greatly altered;
she is no longer the young princess that would publicly
forget etiquette at Westminster for the sake of Robert
Dudley; but she still glitters with jewels and ornaments.
"Next came the Queen, in the sixty-fifth year
of her age, as we were told, very majestic; her face
oblong, fair, but wrinkled, her eyes small, yet black
and pleasant; her nose a little hooked, her lips narrow,
and her teeth black.... She had in her ears two
pearls, with very rich drops; she wore false hair and
that red; upon her head she had a small crown....
Her bosom was uncovered as all the English ladies have
till they marry, and she had on a necklace of exceeding
fine jewels; her hands were small, her fingers long, and
her stature neither tall nor low; her air was stately, her
manner of speaking kind and obliging. That day she
was dressed in white silk, bordered with pearls of the
size of beans, and over it a mantle of black silk, shot
with silver threads ... Instead of a chain, she had
an oblong collar of gold and jewels."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p class='plno'>[<i>p.</i> 97.</p>
</div>

<p>These descriptions of her by Melville and Hentzner
are supplemented, in highly characteristic fashion,
not only by such fancy portraits as the one alluded
to before, where she is represented as a shepherdess,
a nymph, an imaginary being from Arcady, from
mythology, or from nowhere, but by such grave, dignified,
official portraitures as the very fine engraving
left by Rogers. Round the sharp-featured face, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
closed, wilful lips, weary eyes, open, intelligent forehead,
lace ruffs of various shapes, some very bushy, some
quite flat and round-shaped like butterfly wings, are
displayed in most imposing array. No imaginable
kind of gum or starch could keep them straight; they
were spread on iron wires. The gown itself, of cylindric
shape, expanded by means of a farthingale, is
covered with knobs, knots, pearls, ribbons, fringes, and
ornaments of all sorts. Well does this figure deserve
the attention of the student of Shakespeare, for in
this and no other fashion was Cleopatra, the Egyptian
queen, dressed, when she appeared on the boards
of the Globe Theatre. Never did the author of
"Antony" dream of Denderah's temple, and of the soft,
voluptuous face, peacock-covered, representing there
Isis-Cleopatra; but he dressed his Egyptian queen as
the queen he had known had been dressed, and it was
in the costumes of Rogers' engraving, and most appropriately
too, that the Cleopatra of the Globe was heard
to make the remarkable proposal, "Let's to billiards."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Does this seem very strange or in any way incredible?
But we must remember that many years, nay, several
centuries, were to elapse before anything like historical
accuracy was to affect dresses on the stage. Another
Cleopatra trod the boards of the English theatre in the
eighteenth century; she was very different from her
Elizabethan elder sister; she wore <i>paniers</i> and a
Louis XV. wig, and, as may be seen in our engraving,
came in no way nearer the model at Denderah.</p>

<p>The architecture of this period corresponded with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the richness and pomp of the costumes. A new style,
partly from Italy, partly from dreamland, was introduced
into England during the Tudor and early
Jacobean times. There was lace, and knots and knobs
and curious holes, pillars, and pilasters. The sincerest
admirers of antiquity, such as Inigo Jones, who went
to Italy with such good purpose, and there filled his
albums with many exquisite sketches of antique and
Renaissance masterpieces,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> could not refrain from sometimes
introducing Arcady and dreamland into their
architecture. Inigo Jones died before finishing his
Whitehall palace, and we
know from his drawings
that he intended to embellish
the central circular
court with a row of gigantic
caryatides representing
Persians, six or seven yards
high.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> A contriver of
masks for the Court, Inigo
Jones, was in this way
tempted to build palaces,
if one may say so, in <i>mask-style</i>. Such houses as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Audley End, Hatfield, and especially Burghley, this
last being mostly Elizabethan,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> are excellent representations
of the architectural tastes of the time; the
thick windowless towers of a former age are replaced
by palatial fa&ccedil;ades, where countless enormous windows
occupy more space in the wall than the bricks and stones
themselves. Not a few people of a conservative turn
of mind were heard to grumble at these novelties:
"And albeit," said Harrison, in 1577, at the very time
when Lord Burghley was busy building his house in
Northamptonshire, "that in these daies there be manie
goodlie houses erected in the sundrie quarters of this
Iland; yet they are rather curious to the eie, <i>like paper
worke</i> than substantiall for continuance; whereas such
as he [Henry VIII.] did set up, excel in both and
therefore may justlie be preferred farre above all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rest." But notwithstanding such a threatening prophecy
neither at Burghley nor at Hatfield has the
"paper worke" put there been yet blown away by
storm or time, and these houses continue to afford
a safe residence to the descendants of the Cecils.
According to Harrison's judgment the interior of the
new houses, no less than the exterior, testified to a
decadence: "Now have we manie chimnies; and yet
our tenderlings complaine of rheumes, catarhs and
poses. Then had we none but reredosses; and our
heads did never ake. For as the smoke in those daies
was supposed to be a sufficient hardening of the timber
of the house, so it was reputed a far better medicine
to keepe the goodman and his familie from the quacke
or pose, wherewith, as then verie few were acquainted."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But Harrison's blame does not seem to have greatly
affected the taste for chimneys, any more than his
sinister prophecies concerning Elizabethan houses have
been fulfilled; chimneys have continued, and paper-work
houses remain still to help us if need be to understand
the poetry, the drama, and the novel of the period.</p>

see <i>infra</i>, chap. iv. One of the most curious of these denunciations
of travel was the "Quo vadis? a juste censure of travel," by Bishop
Joseph Hall, 1617, 12mo. The author demonstrates that most of
the vices of the English are of foreign importation, chiefly from
France and Italy; good qualities alone are native and national.
The best thing to do, then, is to keep at home.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>LYLY AND HIS "EUPHUES."</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The romance which, at this period, received a new
life, and was to come nearer to our novels than
anything that had gone before, has many traits in
common with the fanciful style of the architecture, costume,
and conversation described above. What have
we to do, thought men, with things practical, convenient,
or of ordinary use? We wish for nothing but
what is brilliant, unexpected, extraordinary. What is
the good of setting down in writing the incidents of
commonplace lives? Are they not sufficiently known
to us? does not their triviality sadden us enough every
day? If we are told stories of imaginary lives, let
them at least be dissimilar from our own; let them offer
unforeseen incidents; let the author be free to turn
aside from reality provided that he leaves the trivial
and the ordinary. Let him lead us to Verona, Athens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
into Arcadia, where he will, but as far as possible from
Fleet Street! And if by ill-luck he sets foot in Fleet
Street, let him at least speak the language of Arcadia!</p>

<p>Authors found this advice excellent, and took good
care to relieve themselves of difficult search after the
mere truth. The public who imposed these laws, this
exacting public of women who read Plutarch and
Plato, who judged the merits of great men as learnedly
as the cut of a ruff, found at the very moment they
most wanted him the author who could please them in
the person of a novel writer, the famous Lyly. At
twenty-five years of age, John Lyly, a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Lord
Burghley, who was at this same time busy with his own
architectural poem, if one may say so, of Burghley
House, wrote "Euphues,"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a new kind too of "paper-work"
with which people were enraptured.</p>

<p>It was written expressly for women, and not only did
the author not conceal the circumstance, but he proclaimed
it aloud. Their opinion alone interested him,
to that of the critics he was indifferent. "It resteth
Ladies," he said, "that you take the paines to read it,
but at such times, as you spend in playing with your
little dogges, and yet will I not pinch you of that pastime,
for I am content that your dogges lie in your
laps: so 'Euphues' may be in your hands, that when
you shall be wearie in reading of the one, you may be
ready to sport with the other.... 'Euphues' had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rather lye shut in a Ladyes casket, then open in a
Schollers studie." Yet after dinner, "Euphues" will
still be agreeable to the ladies, adds Lyly, always
smiling; if they desire to slumber, it will bring them
to sleep which will be far better than beginning to sew
and pricking their fingers when they begin to nod.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>There is no possibility of error; with Lyly commences
in England the literature of the drawing-room,
that of which we speak at morning calls, productions
which, in spite of vast and many changes, still occupy
a favourite place on the little boudoir tables. We must
also notice what pains Lyly gives himself to make his
innovation a success, and so please his patronesses, and
how he ornaments his thoughts and engarlands his
speeches, how cunningly he imbues himself with the
knowledge of the ancients and of foreigners, and what
trouble he gives himself to improve upon the most
learned and the most florid of them. His care was
not thrown away. He was spoiled, petted, and caressed
by the ladies; with an impartial heart they extended to
the author the same favour they granted to the book,
and to their little dogs. He was proclaimed king of
letters by his admirers, and became, in fact, king of the
<i>pr&eacute;cieux</i>. He created a school, and the name of his
hero served to baptize a whole literature. This particular
form of bad style was called <i>euphuism</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Euphuism owes to him its name and its diffusion in
England; but not, although it is usually so stated, its
birth. This strange language, as Dr. Landmann<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> has
well demonstrated, was imported from Spain into England,
and Lyly was not the first to use it in this country.
The works of Guevara, turned into English by five or
six different translators, had a considerable vogue and
acclimatized this extraordinary style in Great Britain.
One of his writings especially, "The golden boke of
Marcus Aurelius, emperour," enjoyed a very great
popularity; it was translated by Lord Berners in 1532,
and by Sir Thomas North in 1557,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and went through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
many editions. The moral dissertations of which it is
full enchanted serious minds; the unusual language of
Spain delighted frivolous souls. Before Lyly, English
authors had already imitated it; but when Lyly
appeared and embellished it even more, enthusiasm
ran so high that its foreign progenitor was forgotten,
and this exotic style was rebaptized as proof of
adoption and naturalization in England.</p>

<p>Since it is not a natural product, but the mere result
of ingenious artifices, nothing is easier than to reduce
it to its component parts, to take it to pieces so to
speak. It consists in an immoderate, prodigious, monstrous
use of similes, so arranged as to set up antitheses
in every limb of the sentence. What is peculiar to the
English imitators, is the employment of alliteration, in
order to better mark the balance of the sentences
written for effect. Finally, the kind of similes even
has something peculiar: they are for the most part
borrowed from an imaginary ancient history and a
fantastical natural history, a sort of mythology of plants
and stones to which the most extraordinary virtues are
attributed.</p>

<p>In the important parts, when he means to use a noble
style, Lyly cannot relate the most trivial incident without
setting up parallels between the sentiments of his
characters and the virtues of toads, serpents, unicorns,
scorpions, and all the fantastical animals mentioned in
Pliny or described in the bestiaries of the Middle Ages.
His knowledge of zoology resembles that of Richard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
de Fournival, who, in the thirteenth century, lamented
in his "Bestiaire d'Amour,"<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that he was like the wolf,
who, when instead of first noticing the man, allowed
the man to see him first, lost all his courage; or like
the cricket who loves chirping so much that he
forgets to eat and allows himself to be caught.
Richard was overcome in like manner by the glances of
his mistress, and all his songs only served to accomplish
his ruin. The woman he loves resembles the
bird called "Kalander," or again, the animal called
"cockatrice" or "cocodrille," which is often mentioned
by Lyly. "Its nature is such that when it finds a man,
then it devours him, and when it has devoured him,
then it laments him all the days of its life."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Such
is the conduct, says Richard, of women too beautiful
and too much beloved.</p>

<p><a name="pl109" id="pl109"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption">the &quot;&aelig;gyptian or land crocodile,&quot; 1608.</span>
<p class='plno'>[<i>p.</i> 109.</p>
</div>

<p>Bestiaries had enjoyed an immense popularity from
the earliest times. They were not all, far from it,
like Richard de Fournival's, love-bestiaries; most of
them had a religious tendency. Such were, for example,
in England, the well-known Anglo-Saxon bestiary,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
or the English bestiary of the thirteenth century, in
which we read of the world-famous wickedness
of the whale who allows sailors to rest on her
back, and even to light a fire thereon, in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
warm themselves; but as soon as she feels the heat
she dives and drowns them all: an example of what
may be expected from the devil. There is, too, the
elephant that leans against a tree to take his rest.
People cunningly cut the tree, and replace it; when the
elephant comes the tree falls and so does he, and is
caught, an emblem of our father Adam, who also owed
his fall to a tree.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Again the "Contes Moralis&eacute;s" of
Nicole Bozon, written in French by a friar who lived
in England in the first half of the fourteenth century,
are also full of the most curious comparisons between
the properties of animals, plants, and minerals, and the
sinful tendencies and frailties of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>These are old, far-off examples, and it might be supposed
that people of education in Elizabethan England
would have possessed a sounder knowledge of natural
history. This was, however, not the case. And if we
wish to know what were the current beliefs among
well-informed men of the time about animals, we have
only to open the two folio volumes penned with greatest
care by painstaking Topsell, concerning "Foure-footed
beastes" and "Serpents."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> We shall then willingly set
Lyly and his followers free from all blame of exaggeration
and improbable inventions. Most often indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
they did not invent; they knew. Topsell's books are
nothing but a careful summary of the then generally
accepted reports concerning animated creation.</p>

<p>His histories are the more curious as his scruples and
earnestness are obvious. His purpose is high, and he
means to write only for the Creator's glory, considering
his subject to be a "part of Divinity that was never
known in English. I take my owne conscience to witness,
which is manifest to my Judge and Saviour, I have
intended nothing but his glory, that is the creator of
all." Secondly, his serious attention to his subject is
shown by what he says of accessible animals; the
engravings he gives of them, of dogs, for instance, of
bulls, asses, and many others being really excellent.
Even rare animals, when by any chance he had secured
a glimpse of them, are represented with the utmost
care; such, for instance, is his chameleon, of which he
gives a very good engraving, not long after careless
Robert Greene had been writing of "this byrd, a
camelion."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>But, then, nature is full of surprises, and so is
Topsell's book. His antelopes are very dangerous
things: "They have hornes ... which are very long
and sharpe; so that Alexander affirmed they pierced
through the sheeldes of his souldiers, and fought with
them very irefully: at which time his companions slew
as he travelled to India, 8,550; which great slaughter
may be the occasion why they are so rare and sildome
seene to this day." Undoubtedly.</p>

<span class="caption">a hippopotamus taking its food, 1607.</span>
<p class='plno'>[<i>p.</i> 113.</p>
</div>

<p>The blood of the elephant has a very strange property:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>"Also it is reported that the blood of an
elephant is the coldest blood in the world and that
Dragons in the scorching heate of summer cannot get
anything to coole them except this blood." The sea-horse,
or hippopotamus, "is a most ugly and filthy
beast, so called because in his voice and mane he resembleth
a horsse, but in his head an oxe or a calfe;
in the residue of his body a swine.... It liveth for
the most part in rivers; yet it is of a doubtful life, for
it brings forth and breedeth on the land." According to
the accompanying engraving he apparently feeds on
crocodiles. The rhinoceros is remarkable for his
breathing: he "hath a necke like unto a horsse and
also the other parts of his body, but it is said to breath
out aire which killeth men."</p>

<p>But in this world of animals, which includes the
Mantichora, the Sphinga, the Papio, and a monster
alive "in the territory of the bishop of Salceburgh,"
the most interesting is the Lamia. It is of such great
interest because its very existence has been disputed,
but quite wrongly. Some untrue reports were circulated
concerning this animal, and as these accounts
were fabulous, people have been found who disbelieved,
not only the stories, but even the possibility that Lami&aelig;
existed. Topsell wisely takes a middle course: "These
and such like stories and opinions there are of Phairies,
which in my judgment arise from the pr&aelig;stigious
apparitions of Devils, whose delight is to deceive and
beguile the minds of men with errour, contrary to the
truths of holye scripture which doeth no where make
mention of such inchaunting creatures; and therefore if
any such be, we will holde them the workes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Devill and not of God." But, then, there are true
Lami&aelig;, and "we shall take for granted by the testimony
of holy scripture that there is such a beast as this."
The particulars Topsell was able to gather about them
are to the following effect: "The hinde parts of this
beast are like unto a goate, his fore legs like a beares,
his upper parts to a woman, the body scaled all over
like a Dragon, as some have observed, by the observation
of their bodies." Their wickedness is so great
that it scarcely bears description: "They are the
swiftest of foot of all earthly beasts, so as none can
escape them by running, for by their celerity, they compasse
their prey of beastes, and by their fraud, they
overthrow men. For when as they see a man, they lay
open their breastes, and by the beauty thereof entice them
to come neare to conference, and so having them within
their compasse, they devoure and kill them." So much
for four-footed beasts.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<span class="caption">the lamia, according to topsell, 1607.</span>
<p class='plno'>[<i>p.</i> 117.</p>
</div>

<p>The "Historie of serpents" is not less instructive,
for it contains, "with their lively figures: names, conditions,
kindes and natures of all venomous beasts: with
their severall poisons and antidotes; their deepe hatred to
mankind and the wonderfull worke of God in their creation
and destruction." Among serpents are included:
bees, drones, wasps, hornets, frogs, toads, tortoises,
spiders, earthworms, and many other unexpected
"venomous beasts." There is in this book information
concerning the boas: "The Latines call it <i>Boa</i> and <i>Bossa</i>
of <i>Bos</i> because by sucking cowes milke it so encreaseth
that in the end it destroyeth all manner of herdes and
cattels." The cockatrice, above named, "seemeth to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the king of serpents ... because of his stately face and
magnanimous mind." The crocodile is to be carefully
avoided, "even the Egyptians themselves account a
crocodile a savage and cruell murthering beast, as may
appeare by their Hieroglyphicks, for when they will
decypher a mad man, they picture a crocodile." And
Topsell goes on to relate the particular hatred which
existed between crocodiles and the inhabitants of
Tentyris, that exquisitely charming Denderah which
overlooks the valley of the Nile, and still deserves its
old fame as the chief temple of the Goddess Athor,
the Egyptian Aphrodite.</p>

<p>The dipsas, the hydra, the dragon, are also endowed
with the most remarkable qualities; but they seem to
have disappeared since Topsell's day. Not so another
very wonderful animal of whom we continue to hear
from time to time, I mean the great sea-serpent; this
marvellous beast is not only described, but depicted in
our naturalist's book. Topsell gives a faithful portrait
of it, and we do the same. These animals are so
big that "many a time, they overthrow in the waters a
laden vessell of great quantitie, with all the wares
therein contained." The engraving shows one of them
upsetting a three-masted Jacobean ship and swallowing
sailors, apparently with great relish and voracity.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Such being the current belief among students of the
natural sciences, we may be the better prepared to excuse
some eccentricities in a novelist. Lyly, who was well
versed in the legendary lore of plants and animals, is
never tired of making a display of his knowledge, but
the wonder is that his readers had never too much of that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
A single erudite or scientific simile never satisfies Lyly;
he has always in his hands a long bead-roll of them,
which he complacently pays out: "The foul toade hath
a faire stone in his head, the fine golde is found in the
filthy earth: the sweet kernell lyeth in the hard shell:
vertue is harboured in the heart of him that most men
esteeme mishapen ... Doe we not commonly see that
in painted pottes is hidden the deadlyest poyson? that
in the greenest grasse is ye greatest serpent? in the
cleerest water the uglyest toade?" and four or five
similes still follow. Tormented by examples, overwhelmed
with similitudes, the adventurous reader, who
to-day risks a reading of "Euphues," feels it impossible
to keep his composure. He would like to protest, to
defend himself, to say that he has lied, this imperturbable
naturalist, that bitter kernels are found indeed
in the hardest shells, that painted pots often contain
something other than poison, and that if toads appear
less ugly in foul water, it is perhaps because they are
the less seen. But what does it matter to Lyly? He
writes for a select coterie, and when a man writes for
a coterie, the protestations of the discontented, of the
envious, alas! of those of good sense, too, are scarcely
of any consequence. Let the common herd then shriek
themselves hoarse at Lyly's door: it is shut fast, he
will hear nothing, and is indifferent even if among this
common herd Shakespeare figures. He is happy;
"Euphues," in company with the little dogs, rumples
the silken laps of ladies with the lace-plaited ruffs.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>But however important style may be, it is not everything
in a literary work. It must be acknowledged
that Lyly's success, if it is no commendation of the
taste of his contemporaries, is greatly to the credit of
their morality and earnestness. By the form of his
sentences Lyly is a Spaniard; he surpasses the most
bombastic, and could give points to that author mentioned
by Louis Racine, who, discovering his mistress
lying under a tree, cried: "Come and see the sun reclining
in the shade!" But the basis of his character is purely
English; he is truly of the same country as Richardson,
and belongs at heart to that race which Tacitus said did
not know how "to laugh at vices," a very high praise
that Rousseau rendered later almost in the same terms.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
From the time of Lyly until our own day, the English
novel, generally speaking, has remained not only moral,
but a moralizing agent; the author has recourse to a
thousand skilful and fascinating devices, and leads us
by the hand through all sorts of flowery paths; but
whatever the manner may be, he almost invariably, without
saying so, leads us to the sermon. There are
sermons in Defoe, who strongly protested against some
abbreviations of his "Robinson Crusoe": "They strip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it of all those reflections as well religious as moral, which
are not only the greatest beauties of the work, but are
calculated for the infinite advantage of the reader."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
There are sermons in Richardson, so much so that it
might rather be said that novels are to be noticed in
Richardson's magnificent series of sermons. This is
the way he himself would have spoken. Did he not
write to Lady Bradsaigh, while forwarding her the last
volumes of "Clarissa": "Be pleased ... to honour these
volumes with a place with your Taylor's Holy Living
and Dying, with your Practice of piety, and Nelson's
Fasts and Festivals, not as being worthy of such
company, but that they may have a chance of being
dipt into thirty years hence. For I persuade myself,
they will not be found utterly unworthy of such a
chance, since they appear in the humble guise of novel,
only by the way of accommodation to the manners and
taste of an age overwhelmed with luxury, and abandoned
to sound and senselessness."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> There are some
sermons in Fielding, many in Dickens, not a few in
George Eliot, and even in Thackeray. Splendid they
are, most eloquent, most admirable in their kind, most
beneficial in their way; but there is no denying that
sermons they are. Unfortunately for Lyly, what
formerly constituted the attraction of "Euphues,"
and hid the sermon's bitterness, makes it to-day
ridiculous and even odious: it is the style. Let us
forget for a moment his unicorns and his scorpions;
taken in himself, his hero deserves attention, because he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
is the ancestor in direct line of Grandison, of Lord
Orville, of Lord Colambre, and of all the sermonizing
lords, and lords of good example, that England owed
to the success of Richardson.</p>

<p>Euphues is a young Athenian, a contemporary not
of Pericles, but of Lyly, who goes to Naples, thence
to England, to study men and governments. Grave
with that gravity peculiar to lay preachers, well-informed
on every subject, even on his own merits,
assured by his conscience that in making mankind
sharer in his illumination, he will assure their salvation,
he addresses moral epistles to his fellow men
to guide them through life. Omniscient like the
inheritors of his vein whom we have heard since, he
instructs the world in the truth about marriage, travel,
religion. He anticipates, in his discourses concerning
aristocracy, the philosophical ideas of "Milord
Edouard," of "Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se" fame; he treats
of love with the wisdom of Grandison, and of the
bringing up of children with the experience of Pamela.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>When women are his subject he is especially earnest
and eloquent, and having, as it seems, suffered much
at their hands he concludes: "Come to me al ye
lovers that have bene deceived by fancy, the glasse of
pestilence, or deluded by woemen, the gate to perdition;
be as earnest to seeke a medicine, as you were eager<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to runne into a mischiefe." Having thus secured,
as it seems, a fairly large audience, he begins his
sermon, which he is pleased to call, "a cooling carde
for Philautus, and all fond lovers."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> His intention
is to give men remedies, which shall cure them of
loving. Some of his precepts resemble the wise advice
of Rondibilis to Panurge; some do not. Philautus is
to avoid solitude, and idleness; he must study. In
the same way Panurge is recommended <i>labeur assidu</i>
and <i>fervente estude</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Philautus is advised to try law,
"whereby thou mayest have understanding of olde and
auntient customes;" if law proves of no avail, there
is "Physicke," and if this again fails, then there is
"the atteining of ye sacred and sincere knowledge of
divinitie." Study then may be supplemented by contemptuous
meditations about women;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> a remedy
which Rabelais, who probably knew more of life than
twenty-five-years-old Lyly, refrains from recommending.</p>

<p>This part of the anathema, including as it does
a description of the superfluities of Elizabethan dress,
is especially worth noticing: "Take from them,"
cries Euphues, in a burst of eloquence, "their perywigges,
their paintings, their jewells, their rowles, their
boulstrings, and thou shalt soone perceive that a woman
is the least part of hir selfe. When they be once
robbed of their robes, then wil they appeare so odious,
so ugly, so monstrous, that thou wilt rather think them
serpents then saints, and so like hags, that thou wilt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
feare rather to be enchaunted than enamoured. Looke
in their closettes, and there shalt thou finde an appoticaryes
shop of sweete confections, a surgions boxe of
sundry salves, a pedlers packe of newe fangles. Besides
all this their shadows, their spots, their lawnes, their
leefekyes, their ruffes, their rings, shew them rather
cardinalls curtisans then modest matrons.... If every
one of these things severally be not of force to move
thee, yet all of them joyntly should mortifie thee."
This was, however, by no means the case, and Philautus
not so much "cooled" by this "carde" as his friend
expected, behaved himself in such a way as to
demonstrate that, according to his experience, here
was gross exaggeration indeed.</p>

<p>Euphues shows better knowledge of the heart of
woman when, continuing his analysis of women's foibles,
he comes to give his friend information that teaches
him in fact rather how to be loved than how to
cease loving: "Yet if thou be so weake being bewitched
with their wiles that thou hast neither will to
eschue nor wit to avoyd their company ... yet at the
hearte dissemble thy griefe ... cary two faces in one
hood, cover thy flaming fancie with fained ashes ...
let thy hewe be merry when thy heart is melancholy,
beare a pleasaunt countenaunce with a pined conscience....
Love creepeth in by stealth, and by stealth slideth
away. If she breake promise with thee in the night,
or absent hir selfe in the day, seeme thou carelesse, and
and then will she be carefull; if thou languish [<i>i.e.</i>,
becomest slack in thy suit], then wil she be lavish of
hir honour, yea and of the other strange beast her
honestie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>He continues in this bitter vein, avenging, as it
seems, his private wrongs, and vowing never, as far as
he is himself concerned to have anything more to do
with women. From them, he is naturally led to think
of children who form an equally good theme on
which to moralise. He does not fail in this duty, and
writes for the good of his friend, and of the public at
large, a little treatise very much in the style of some
of Pamela's letters,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> where we are taught how
"Eph&#339;bus," the child that is to be, should be brought
up. Eph&#339;bus is the Emile of this sixteenth-century
Rousseau. Always thorough and exact, Lyly is careful
to begin at the beginning, informing us at first "that
the childe shoulde be true borne and no bastarde."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Then he comes to the bringing up of the boy, and
with as much earnestness as Jean-Jacques, and with
true and moving eloquence, he beseeches the mother
to be the nurse of her own progeny. "It is most
necessary and most naturall in mine opinion, that the
mother of the childe be also the nurse, both for the
entire love she beareth to the babe, and the great desire
she hath to have it well nourished: for is there any
one more meete to bring up the infant than she that
bore it? or will any be carefull for it, as she that
bredde it?... Is the earth called the mother of all
things onely bicause it bringeth forth? No, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
bicause it nourisheth those things that springe out of
it. Whatsoever is bred in ye sea is fed in the sea; no
plant, no tree, no hearbe commeth out of the ground
that is not moystened, and as it were noursed of the
moysture and mylke of the earth; the lyonesse nurseth
hir whelps, the raven cherisheth hir byrdes, the viper
her broode, and shal a woman cast away her babe?</p>

<p>"I accompt it cast away which in the swath clouts is
cast aside, and lyttle care can the mother have which
can suffer such crueltie: and can it be tearmed with
any other title then cruelty, the infant yet looking redde
of the mother, the mother yet breathing through the
torments of hir travaile, the child crying for helpe which
is said to move wilde beastes, even in the selfe said
moment it is borne, or the nexte minute, to deliver to
a straunge nurse, which perhappes is neither wholesome
in body, neither honest in manners, whiche esteemeth
more thy argent though a trifle, then thy tender
infant, thy greatest treasure?" Here Lyly is at his
best, and neither Richardson nor Rousseau spoke better
on this point, which is one of their favourite subjects.</p>

<p>He goes on to show how his child should be brought
up, with what principles he should be imbued; many
of these principles again very much resembling those
Rousseau was to accept and propagate two hundred
years later: "It is good nurture that leadeth to virtue,
and discreete demeanour that playneth the path to
felicitie.... To be a noble man it is most excellent,
but that is our ancestors ... as for our nobilytie, our
stocke, our kindred, and whatsoever we ourselves have
not done I scarcely accompt ours.... It is vertue,
yea vertue, gentlemen, that maketh gentlemen....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
These things [<i>i.e.</i>, knowledge, reason, good sense],
neither the whirling wheele of Fortune can chaunge
neither the deceitful cavilling of worldlings separate,
neither sickenesse abate, neither age abolish." Then
follows a dialogue between Euphues and an atheist,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
in which I need not say the latter is utterly routed;
and the book ends with a collection of letters<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> between
Euphues and various people who ask and get his advice
on their difficulties, oracle-wise, Pamela-wise too.</p>

<p>In the second part of his romance, which appeared
in 1580,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Lyly gives a kind of <i>Lettres persanes</i>, but
<i>Lettres persanes</i> reversed, Montesquieu making use
of his foreigner to satirize France, and Lyly of his to
eulogize his native land. Euphues comes to England
with his friend Philautus, and, since he knows everything,
instructs the latter as they go along. He warns
him against wine, gambling, and debauchery, teaches
him geography, and points out to him what is worth
seeing. Philautus does not retort that Euphues is a
pedant, which proves him to be very good tempered
and a perfect travelling companion. The two friends
are enchanted with the country: its natural products,
its commerce, its agriculture, its inhabitants and their
manners, its bishops and their flocks, the civil government,
the religious government, everything is perfect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
English gentlewomen are prodigies of wisdom and
beauty; and indeed that is the least Lyly can say of
them, since it is for them that he is writing. When
he spoke, as we have seen, disparagingly of women,
he meant Italian women (none of whom, as a matter
of fact, he had ever known or even seen), not Englishwomen.
These spend their mornings "in devout
prayer," and not in bed like the ladies of Italy; they
read the Scriptures instead of Ariosto and Petrarch;
they are so beautiful that the traveller is enraptured
and cannot help crying out: "There is no beauty but
in England." To sum up, "they are in prayer devoute,
in bravery humble, in beautie chast, in feasting
temperate, in affection wise, in mirth modest, in all
their actions though courtlye, bicause woemen, yet
Aungels, bicause virtuous." As for the women of
other countries, they all have lovers and spend their
time in painting their faces.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Having verified such important differences, Philautus
cannot do less than find a wife in England, and
Euphues, whose unsociable humour prevents his doing
likewise, carries away with him into his native land
the remembrance of "a place, in my opinion (if any
such may be on the earth) not inferiour to a paradise,"
and of a Queen "of singuler beautie and chastitie,
excelling in the one Venus, in the other Vesta."</p>

<p>It is, however, appropriate to recollect that at the time
of the Renaissance, before the blossoming in England of
this literature for ladies, Caxton too had enumerated the
chief qualities of the women of his country. They are
the same as in Lyly, only, as we shall see, the honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
printer closes his remarks with a slight reservation. In
the preface placed at the beginning of a work translated
from the French by Lord Rivers, he states that in the
translation, several passages reflecting on the female
sex were suppressed; that is easily understood; they
would have no application in England; "for I wote
wel," says he, "of whatsomever condicion women ben in
Grece, the women of this contre ben right good, wyse,
playsant, humble, discrete, sobre, chast, obedient to their
husbandis, trewe, secrete, stedfast, ever besy and never
ydle, attemperat in speking and vertuous in all their
werkis"&mdash;"or," he is fain to add, "atte leste sholde
be soo."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> And thereupon, Caxton, on his own
authority, restores the suppressed passages.</p>

<p>From the particular point of view of the historian
of the English novel, Lyly with all his absurdities had
yet one merit which must be taken into account. With
him we leave epic and chivalrous stories and approach
the novel of manners. There is no longer question
of Arthur and his marvellous knights, but rather
of contemporary men, who, in spite of excessive
oratorical gew-gaws, possess some resemblance to
reality. Conversations are reported in which we find
the tone of well-born persons of the period. Lyly
takes care also to be very exact in his dates. Having
announced at the end of his first volume that Euphues
was about to set out for England, he informs us in the
beginning of the second, which appeared in 1580, that
the embarkation took place on December 1, 1579.
He would, for anything, have gone so far as to give
an engraved portrait of his hero, just as we were to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
see later, at the beginning of a book destined to make
some noise in the world, the portrait of "Captain
Lemuel Gulliver of Redriff." Undoubtedly his
opinions on men and life, his analysis of sentiment,
are rather clumsily blended with the story and savour
of the awkwardness of a first attempt; but there was
however merit in making the attempt, and it is not
impossible at distant intervals to discover under the
crust of pedantry some well-turned passage, possessing
eloquence, as we have seen, or, more rarely, a sort of
humour. It is thus that a tolerably good lesson may
be drawn from the adventures of Philautus in London,
who, deeply smitten with the charms of a young English
lady, consults a sorcerer in order to obtain a philtre that
will inspire love. Here was an excellent opportunity,
which the magician does not fail to seize, of talking
about serpents and toads. But, after a long enumeration
of the bones, stones, and livers of animals that cause
love, the alchemist, urged by Philautus, ends by confessing
that the best sorcery of all to gain the loving
regard of a woman, is to be handsome, witty, and
charming.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>By his defects and his merits, his wisdom, his gracefulness
and also his bad style, Lyly could not fail to
please. His public was ready when he began writing,
a public with many frivolous tastes and many serious
instincts. The lightness of tone and of behaviour
which struck a foreigner coming for the first time to
the English court or a professional censor who by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
trade is meant to see nothing else, was misleading as
showing only the surface of the sort of mankind that
was flourishing there at that time. This lightness of
tone, however, did exist nevertheless, and those who
assumed it were not slow to embellish their speeches
with flowers from Lyly's paper garden. The austere
French Huguenot, Hubert Languet, the friend and
adviser of Sir Philip Sidney, who visited England in
the very year "Euphues" was published, was very
much astonished to see how English courtiers behaved
themselves; accustomed as he was to the grave talk
he enjoyed with his young friend, he had imagined,
it seems, that no other was relished by him or by
anybody in Queen Elizabeth's palaces. When he left
the country he wrote to Sidney his opinion of the
manners he had observed. It is simply a confirmation
of what Ascham had stated sometime before, when he
wrote of his travelled compatriots: neither of them
did justice to the more serious qualities hidden under
all this courtly trifling: "It was a delight to me last
winter," says Languet, "to see you high in favour and
enjoying the esteem of all your countrymen; but to
speak plainly, the habits of your court seemed to me
somewhat less manly than I could have wished, and
most of your noblemen appeared to me to seek for
a reputation more by a kind of affected courtesy than
by those virtues which are wholesome to the State,
and which are most becoming to generous spirits and
to men of high birth. I was sorry therefore, and so
were other friends of yours, to see you wasting the
flower of your life on such things, and I feared lest
that noble nature of yours should be brought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
take pleasure in pursuits which only enervate the
mind."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Lyly's book proved well suited to this public; it
went through numerous editions; it was printed five
times during the first six years of its publication, and
new editions were issued from time to time till 1636.
It gave birth, as we shall see, to many imitations; the
name of Euphues on the title-page of a novel was for
years considered a safe conduct to the public, if not to
posterity; books purporting to be Euphues' legacies or
copies of Euphues' papers, or bearing in some way or
other the stamp of his supposed approbation, multiplied
accordingly. The movement increased rapidly, but it
was not to last long; in fact, it did not continue beyond
ten or twelve years; after this time the monuments of
the euphuistic literature were still reprinted, but no
addition was made to their number.</p>

<p>This period, however, was filled in a measure with
the product of Lyly's brains or that of his imitators.
All who prided themselves on elegance spoke his
affected language, and studied in his book the mythology
of plants. Edward Blount, a bookseller who
reprinted Lyly's comedies in the following century, at a
time when these courtly dramas were beginning to
be forgotten, has well expressed the kindly and sympathetic
favour accorded to Lyly by the ladies of
Elizabethan days: "These papers of his," says he, "lay
like dead lawrels in a churchyard; but I have gathered
the scattered branches up, and by a charme, gotten from
Apollo, made them greene againe and set them up as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
epitaphes to his memory. A sinne it were to suffer
these rare monuments of wit to lye covered in dust and
a shame such conceipted comedies should be acted by
none but wormes. Oblivion shall not so trample on a
sonne of the Muses; and such a sonne as they called
their darling. Our nation are in his debt for a new
English which he taught them. 'Euphues and his
England' began first that language; all our ladyes
were then his schollers; and that beautie in court, which
could not parley eupheueisme was as little regarded, as
shee which now there speakes not French."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It may
be appropriately recalled here that this same Blount
who thus eulogizes Lyly had published already another
set of Elizabethan dramas, and a much more important
one, viz., the first folio of Shakespeare in 1623.</p>

<p>Those comedies which Blount thought fit to reprint,
considering that in so doing he was presenting to his
readers "a Lilly growing in a grove of lawrels," are
another proof of the success Lyly had, through his
novel, secured for himself at court. His plays are
mythological or pseudo-historical dramas, interspersed
with some pretty songs and dialogues, and were performed
by children before the Queen on holy-days.
Among others were his "Campaspe," "played before
the Queenes Majestie, on new yeares day at night, by
Her Majesties children and the children of Paules,"
1584; his "Sapho and Phao," performed also before the
Queen by the same children, on Shrove Tuesday, 1584;
his "Endimion, the man in the moone," played before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the Queen "at Greenwich on Candlemass day at night, by
the chyldren of Paules"; "Gallathea," played on New
Year's Day; "Midas," performed on Twelfth Night,
also before the Queen, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>On love matters and women's affairs, he was considered
an authority; the analysis of the passions and
the knowledge of the deeper moods of the soul, which
many consider to be, among novelists, a new-born
science, were regarded by his contemporaries as a thing
wholly his, a discovery made by himself; not foreseeing
his successors, they proclaimed him a master of
his newly invented art. Beginners would come to him
for advice or for a preface, as they go now to the heirs
of his art, especially when love is their theme. In this
way Thomas Watson published in 1582 his "Passionate
Centurie of Love," and prefaced it, as with a certificate
of its worth, by a letter from Lyly: "My good friend,
I have read your new passions, and they have renewed
mine old pleasures, the which brought to me no lesse
delight, then they have done to yourself commendations....
Such is the nature of persuading pleasure,
that it melteth the marrow before it scorch the skin
... not unlike unto the oyle of jeat which rotteth the
bone and never rankleth the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It was useless for wise minds to grumble; Lyly always
found women to applaud him. In vain did Nash,
twelve years after the appearance of "Euphues," scoff
at the enthusiasm with which he had read the book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
when he was "a little ape in Cambridge";<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> vainly was
Euphuism derided on the stage before a Cambridge
audience: "There is a beaste in India call'd a polecatt ... and
the further she is from you the less you smell
her," a piece of information that contains more probability
than perhaps any given by Lyly.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Vainly, too,
Shakespeare showed his opinion of the style in lending
it to Falstaff when the worthy knight wishes to admonish
Prince Henry in the manner of courts. Grown
old in his tavern, Falstaff has no idea that these refinements,
fashionable at the time when he was as slender
as his page, may be now the jest of the young generation:
"There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often
heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the
name of pitch: this pitch, as ancient writers do report,
doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest: for,
Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in
tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words
only, but in woes also."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Many persons to whom the book doubtless recalled
the memory of their spring-time, shared Falstaff's
ingenuousness, and remained faithful to Lyly; if men
or letters, after some years of enthusiasm, ceased to
imitate him, his book was for a long time continuously
read, and it was reprinted again and again even in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
reign of Charles I. It was translated into Dutch in the
same century,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and was modernized in the following,
under the title: "The false friend and the inconstant
mistress: an instructive novel ... displaying the artifices
of the female sex in their amours."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> High praise
is rendered by the editor to Lyly, who "was a great
refiner of the English tongue in those days." The
book appeared not very long before Richardson's
"Pamela," a fact worthy of notice, the more so as in
this abbreviation of Euphues, the letters contained
in the original have been reproduced and look the more
conspicuous in the little pamphlet. Quite Richardsonian,
too, is the table of contents which is rather a
table of good precepts and useful information, a very
different table from the one appended by Harington to
his "Ariosto." Here we find enumerated the many wise
recommendations by which Lyly so long anticipated
Richardson and Rousseau:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="quotes">
<tr><td class='thang'>"The mother ought to be her own nurse</td><td align='right'>p. 83.&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class='thang'>"The wild beasts more tender of their young than those who nurse not their own children</td><td align='right'>p. 83.&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class='thang'>"Children not to be frightened with stories of spirits and bugbears (&amp;c.)</td><td align='right'>p. 86."</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>So much for the continuation of Lyly's fame. As
for the period of imitation proper, the era of euphuism's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
full glory, it lasted, as we have said, hardly more than
twelve or at most fifteen years. But it saw the birth
of works that are not without importance in the history
of the origin of the novel in this country.</p>

his language, but even many of his ideas. The same essay contains
very useful information on Gongorism and other kinds of affected
styles of the sixteenth century. See also Dr. Landmann's "Der

into French in 1531, and went through a great many editions,
entitled sometimes "Le Livre dor&eacute; de Marc-Aur&egrave;le"; sometimes
"L'Horloge des princes." North's translation, which followed
the French editions, is entitled, "The Diall of Princes, by
Guevara, englyshed out of the Frenche," London, 1557, fol.;
it had several editions. It is to the Marcus Aurelius of Guevara
that La Fontaine alludes in his "Paysan du Danube"; the story
of the peasant was one of the most popular of the "Golden
Boke." Guevara's style, with all the supplementary embellishments
that Lyly has added, was already to be seen in the
collection of short stories by Pettie, 1576 (<i>supra</i>, p. 81) of
which one of the early editions begins like "Euphues," with an
epistle to the "gentlewomen readers."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>LYLY'S LEGATEES.</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>All Lyly's imitators, Greene, Lodge, Melbancke,
Riche, Munday, Warner, Dickenson, and others,
did not faithfully copy his style in all its
peculiarities, at any rate in all their works; some of
them borrowed only his ideas, others his plot; others
his similes; most of them, however, when they first
began to write, went the fullest length in imitation, and
tricked themselves out in euphuistic tinsel. They were
careful by choosing appropriate titles for their novels
to publicly connect themselves with the euphuistic
cycle. "Euphues" was a magic pass-word, and they
well knew that the name once pronounced, the doors of
the "boudoirs," or closets as they were then called, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the hands of the fair ladies, were sure to open; the book
was certain to be welcome.</p>

<p>Hence the number of writers who declared themselves
Euphues' legatees and executors. Year after
year, for a while, readers saw issuing from the press
such books as "Zelauto, the fountaine of Fame ...
containing a delicate disputation ... given for a
friendly entertainment to Euphues at his late arrival
into England," by Munday, 1580; or as "Euphues his
censure to Philautus, wherein is presented a philosophicall
combat betweene Hector and Achylles," by
Robert Greene, 1587: "Gentlemen," says the author to
the readers, "by chance, some of Euphues loose papers
came to my hand, wherein hee writ to his friend Philautus
from Silexedra, certaine principles necessary to bee
observed by every souldier." Or there was "Menaphon,
Camillas alarum to slumbering Euphues," by the same,
1589; "Rosalynde, Euphues golden legacie, found after
his death in his cell at Silexedra," by Thomas Lodge,
1590; "Arisbas, Euphues amidst his slumbers," by John
Dickenson, 1594, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> All these authors continued
their model's work in contributing to the development
of literature written chiefly for ladies; in that way
especially was Lyly's initiative fruitful.</p>

<p>Barnabe Riche, for example, publishes "Don Simonides,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>a story of a foreigner who travels in Italy
and then comes to London, like Euphues, mixes
in good society, and makes the acquaintance of Philautus;
he writes this romance "for the amusement
of our noble gentilmen as well as of our
honourable ladies." He wrote also a series of short
stories,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> this time "for the onely delight of the
courteous gentlewoemen bothe of England and Irelande;"
and, for fear they should forget his design of
solely pleasing them, he addresses them directly in
the course of his narrative: "Now, gentilwomen, doe
you thinke there could have been a greater torment
devised, wherewith to afflicte the harte of Silla?"
Shakespeare, an assiduous reader of collections of this
kind, and who, unfortunately for their authors, has
not transmitted his taste to posterity, was acquainted
with Riche's tales, and drew from this same story of
Silla the principal incidents of his "Twelfth Night."
Riche himself had taken it from the "Histoires
tragiques" of Belleforest, and Belleforest had translated
it from Bandello.</p>

<p>Munday's Zelauto<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> is also a traveller. A son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the Duke of Venice, he goes on his travels, after the
example of Euphues, visiting Naples and Spain, where
he falls "in the company of certain English merchants,"
very learned merchants, "who, in the Latin tongue, told
him the happy estate of England and how a worthy
princes governed their common wealth." He comes
accordingly to this country, for which he feels an admiration
equal to Euphues' own. From thence he "takes
shipping into Persia," and visits Turkey, prepared upon
any emergency to fight valiantly or to speak eloquently,
his hand and tongue being equally ready with thrusts
and parries, or comparisons and similes.</p>

<p>Again we find Lyly's manner in Melbancke's
"Philotimus,"<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> 1583, a book full, as "Euphues," of
letters, dialogues, and philosophical discussions, and in
Warner's "Pan his Syrinx," 1584. Warner, whose fame
mainly rests on his long poem, "Albion's England,"
published in 1586, began his literary career as a novelist
of the euphuistic school. In common with many
youths of all times, of whom Lyly was one, he was
scarcely out of "non-age," to use his own word, than
he wanted to impart to his fellow-men his experience
of a life, for him just begun, and to teach them how to
behave in a world of which he knew only the outside.
He lands his hero, Sorares, "in a sterile and harborlesse
island," not a rare occurrence even in novels anterior to
Defoe; Sorares' sons start to find him. Both they and
their father meet with sundry adventures, in the course
of which they tell or hear stories and take part in
various "controversies and complayntes." Many topics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
are philosophically discussed; the chief being, as in
Lyly, woman. One of the speakers puts forward the
assertion that there may be, after all, some good in
women; but another demonstrates that there is none
at all; and that their name of "wo-man" contains their
truest definition. Whereupon, we are treated once
more to a description of dresses and fashions: "Her
face painted, her beautie borrowed, her haire an others,
and that frisled, her gestures enforced, her lookes premeditated,
her backe bolstred, her breast bumbasted,
her shoulders bared and her middle straite laced, and
then is she in fashion!" Of course this does not apply
to English, but to Scythian and Assyrian ladies. This
description is followed, as in Lyly, by a proper antidote,
and with a number of rules to be observed by all the
honest people who desire to escape the wiles of the
feminine sex.</p>

<p>Warner's book had some success; it reached a second
edition in 1597,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in which the author states that two
writers, at least, copied him, sometimes "verbatim"
without any acknowledgment; one of them seems to
have been no less a person than Robert Greene, "a
scholler," says Warner, "better than my selfe on whose
grave the grasse now groweth green, whom otherwise,
though otherwise to me guiltie, I name not." Several
incidents in Greene's works resemble Warner's stories,
especially the one called "Opheltes," the plot of which
forcibly reminds us of "Francesco's Fortunes," and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the same time of a different work of greater fame, the
"Two Gentlemen of Verona."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>When Warner spoke, apparently, of Greene as a
"scholler" better than himself he was quite right, and
as a matter of fact, Lyly's two most famous disciples
were Thomas Lodge, a friend of Riche, who helped him
to revise his works and corrected his faulty verses, and
Robert Greene, a novelist and dramatist like Lodge and
Lyly, and a friend of the former. Endowed with a less
calm and sociable temperament than their model, Greene
and Lodge led a chequered existence very characteristic
of their epoch.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>With Robert Greene we are in the midst of
Bohemia, not exactly the Bohemia which M&uuml;rger
described and which dies in the hospital: the hospital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
corresponds in some manner to ideas of order and rule;
under Elizabeth men remained irregular to the end;
literary men who were not physicians like Lodge, or
shareholders in a theatre like Shakespeare, or subsidized
by the Court like Ben Jonson, died of hunger in the
gutter, or of indigestion at a neighbour's house, or of
a sword-thrust in the tavern. Therein is one of the
peculiarities of the period. It distinguishes the Bohemia
of Elizabeth from other famous Bohemias, that of Grub
Street, known to Dr. Johnson, and that of the <i>quartier
latin</i> described by M&uuml;rger.</p>

<p>Greene was one of the most original specimens of
the unfortunate men who in the time of Elizabeth
attempted to live by their pen. He was as remarkable
for his extravagances of conduct as for his talents,
sometimes gaining money and fame by the success of his
writings, sometimes sinking into abject poverty and
consorting with the outcasts of society. Of all the
writers of the Elizabethan period he is perhaps the
one whose life and character we can best picture to
ourselves; for in his last years, repentant and sorrow-stricken,
he wrote with the utmost sincerity autobiographical
tales and pamphlets, which are invaluable as
a picture of the times; they are, in fact, nothing else
than the "Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de Boh&egrave;me" of Elizabethan
England.</p>

<p>In these books Greene gives us the key to his own
character, to his many adventures, and to his miserable
end. There were two separate selves in him, and they
proved incompatible. One was full of reasonable,
sensible, and somewhat <i>bourgeois</i> tendencies, highly
appreciating honour respectability, decorum, civic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
patriotic virtues; of women liking only those that
were pure, of men those that were honest, religious
and good citizens. Greene's other self was not, properly
speaking, the counterpart of the first, and had no taste
for vices as vices, nor for disorder as disorder,
but was wholly and solely bent upon <i>enjoyment</i>,
immediate enjoyment whatever be the sort, the cost, or
the consequence. Hence the glaring discrepancies in
Greene's life, his faults, not to say his crimes, his sudden
short-lived repentances, his supplications to his friends
not to imitate his example, his incapacity to follow
steadily one course or the other. His better self kept
his writings free from vice, but was powerless to control
his conduct. This struggle between the forces of good
and evil is exceedingly well depicted in Greene's
Repentances, under his own or fictitious names; of
all the heroes of his tales he is himself the most
interesting and the most deeply studied. As a novel
writer and an observer of human nature, his own portrait
is perhaps his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Greene was born at Norwich about 1560, and
belonged to a family in easy circumstances. He was
sent to Cambridge, where he was admitted to St. John's
College on November, 1575. There, according to a
propensity that was inborn, he at once associated with
noisy, unprincipled young fellows. This propensity
accompanied him through life, and led him to constantly
surround himself with a rabble of merry companions,
to be greatly liked by them, but to make few
sincere friends, and to quarrel with these very often,
to drop their acquaintance, to befriend them again,
and so on to the last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The universities at that time were not places of
edification; and Lyly, who during the same period had
a personal experience of them, was careful when,
shortly afterwards, he wrote his advice for the education
of "Eph&#339;bus" to warn fathers of the dangers
of university life: "To speak plainly of the disorder
of Athens [that is, Oxford] who does not se it and
sorrow at it? Such playing at dice, such quaffing of
drink, such daliaunce with women, such dauncing,
that in my opinion there is no quaffer in Flaunders
so given to tipplyng, no courtier in Italy so given
to ryot, no creature in the world so misled as a
student in Athens." Many return from the universities
"little better learned, but a great deal worse
lived, then when they went, and not only unthrifts
of their money, but also banckerouts of good manners."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Greene did not fail to choose his associates among
people of this sort, and with some of them he crossed
over to the continent in his turn to visit "Circe."
"Being at the University of Cambridge, I light
amongst wags as lewd as my selfe, with whome I consumed
the flower of my youth, who drew me to travell
into Italy and Spaine, in which places I saw and practizde
such villainie as is abhominable to declare...."
He comes back, and after the pleasures and excitement
of travel, ordinary every-day life seems to him
tasteless; the mere idea of a regular career of any sort
is abhorrent to him. "At my return into England, I
ruffeled out in my silks, in the habit of <i>Malcontent</i>, and
seemed so discontent that no place would please me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
abide in, nor no vocation cause mee to stay myselfe
in."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>In this uncertainty, and with his head full of Italian
remembrances and romantic adventures, he thought,
being not yet twenty, to try his hand at writing. His
first attempt was a novel, a love story in the Italian
fashion, in which very much loving was to do for very
little probability and less observation of character and
nature. It was called "Mamillia"; it was finished in
1580, and published three years later.</p>

<p>Greene at that time was again in Cambridge, and
strange to say, among the many whims that crossed his
mind, a fancy took him to apply himself to study.
Gifted as he was, this caused him no trouble; he
acquired much varied knowledge, of which his writings
show sufficient proof, and was received M.A. in 1583.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
He then left the university and went to London, where
the most curious part of his life, that was to last only
nine years longer, began.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>The reception awarded to "Mamillia" seems to have
encouraged him to continue writing. It had, in fact,
crude as it seems to us now, many qualities that would
ensure it a welcome: its style was euphuistic; its tone
was Italian; its plot was intricate, and, lastly, there was
very much love in it. He continued therefore in this
vein, writing with extreme facility and rapidity improbable
love stories, with wars, kings, and princesses,
with euphuism and mythology, with Danish, Greek,
Egyptian and Bohemian adventures. There was a
"Myrrour of Modesty" which has for its heroine the
chaste Susannah, a "Gwydonius, the card of fancie,"
again a tale in the Italian style, an "Arbasto" which
tells of the wars and loves of a Danish king, a "Morando,"
containing a series of discussions and speeches on love,
all of them entered or published in 1584-6. Then came
his "Planetomachia," 1585, where the several planets
describe and exemplify their influence on human fate;
"Penelopes web," 1587, containing a succession of short
stories; "Perimedes," 1588, imitated from Boccaccio;
"Pandosto," a tale of Bohemian and Sicilian kings and
shepherds, which had an immense success, much greater
according to appearances than the exquisite drama of
a "Winter's Tale," that Shakespeare drew from it.
"Alcida," a story of the metamorphosis of three young
love-stricken princesses of an island "under the pole
antartike," was apparently published in the same year;
"Menaphon," a charming pastoral tale, appeared in
1589, and several others followed. His popularity was
soon considerable; his books were in all the shops;
several went through an extraordinary number of
editions; his name was better known than any: "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
became," says he, "an author of playes, and a penner of
love pamphlets, so that I soone grew famous in that
qualitie," and who then "for that trade" was there
"so ordinarie about London as <i>Robin Greene</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>As for his beginning to write plays, he has left a
lively account of the casual meeting which led to his
becoming attached to a company of players and to be
for a time their playwright in ordinary. It was at a
moment when his purse was empty; for as he quaintly
puts it in one of his stories: "so long went the pot to
the water, that at last it came broken home; and so long
put he his hand into his purse that at last the emptie
bottome returned him a writt of <i>non est inventus</i>; for
well might the divell dance there for ever a crosse to
keepe him backe."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In this difficulty he met by chance
a brilliantly dressed fellow who seemed to be a cavalier,
and happened to be a player. It is a well-known fact
that if scenery was scanty in Elizabethan play-houses,
the players' dresses were very costly, and if need there
was, this would be an additional proof that no monetary
consideration would have induced the young man
who played, for example, the part of Shakespeare's
Cleopatra, to appear in less than queenly ruffs and
farthingales, such as Rogers has represented in his
portrait of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"What is your profession? said Roberto [that is,
Robert Greene].<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p>"Truely, sir, said he, I am a player.</p>

<p>"A player, quoth Roberto; I tooke you rather
for a gentleman of great living, for if by outward
habit men should be censured, I tell you, you woud be
taken for a substantiall man.</p>

<p>"So am I, where I dwell, quoth the player, reputed
able at my proper cost, to build a windmill.
What, though the worlde once went hard with me, when
I was faine to carrie my playing fardle a footebacke;
<i>tempora mutantur</i> ... it is otherwise now; for my share
in playing apparell will not be solde for two hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>The player goes on relating his own successes, the
parts he performs, and how he had been himself for a
while the playwright of his troop, but that had been
some time ago; tastes are changing and his wit is now
out of fashion: "Nay, more, I can serve to make a
prettie speech, for I was a countrie author, passing at
a morall, for it was I that pende the moral of mans
wit, the Dialogue of Dives, and for seaven yeeres space
was absolute interpreter of the puppets. But now my
Almanacke is out of date:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The people make no estimation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of morals teaching education.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Was not this prettie for a plaine rime extempore?
If ye will, ye shall have more.</p>

<p>"Nay, it is enough, said Roberto, but how meane
you to use mee?</p>

<p>"Why, sir, in making playes, said the other, for
which you shall be well paid, if you will take the
paines."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Greene did so, and with no mean success. He grew
more and more famous, and, without becoming more
wealthy, had the pleasure of being able to squander at
one time much larger sums of money than before:
"Roberto was now famozed for an arch-playmaking-poet;
his purse, like the sea, somtime sweld, anon like
the same sea fell to a low ebb; yet seldom he wanted,
his labors were so well esteemed."</p>

<p>He had not yet broken all connection with his birth-place
and his family, and some of his visits were for
him memorable ones. During one of them he was
seized with a sudden fit of repentance for the loose life
he had been leading in London; the better man in
him made himself heard, and he fell into such an abyss
of misery and despair as to remind us of the great
conversions of the Puritan epoch. In fact, his companions,
when he again saw them, wondering at his
altered countenance, called him a Puritan. "Once I
felt a feare and horrour in my conscience, and then the
terrour of Gods judgementes did manifestly teach me
that my life was bad, that by sinne I deserved damnation,
and that such was the greatnes of my sinne that
I deserved no redemption. And this inward motion
I received in St. Andrews church in the cittie of
Norwich, at a lecture or sermon then preached by a
godly learned man.... At this sermon the terrour
of Gods judgementes did manifestly teach me, that
my exercises were damnable, and that I should bee
wipte out of the booke of life, if I did not speedily
repent my loosenes of life, and reforme my misdemeanors."</p>

<p>In the same way, in the next century, George Fox the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Quaker, John Bunyan, and many others, were to find
themselves awe-stricken at the thought of God's judgment;
in the same way also, and in almost the same
words, the hero of a novel that was to be world-famous
in the following age was to express the sudden horror
he felt when remorse began to prey upon him. "No
one," wrote Robinson Crusoe, in his journal, "that
shall ever read this account will expect that I shall be
able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision." But Greene differed from them all by the
short duration of his anxieties: "This good notion
lasted not long in mee, for no sooner had I met with
my copesmates, but seeing me in such a solemn humour,
they demaunded the cause of my sadnes ... they fell
upon me in a jeasting manner, calling me Puritane and
Presizian, and wished I might have a pulpit." And
soon the good effect of the godly vision in St. Andrew's
church wore away.</p>

<p>He allowed another chance of escaping his final doom
to pass in the same manner. Famous as he was all
over the country, witty and brilliant, with such patrons
as Leicester, Essex and Arundel, to whom several of
his works are dedicated, he became acquainted with "a
gentlemans daughter of good account." He loved her;
his suit was favoured, and he married her, about 1586.
He lived with her for a year and they had a boy; but
she objected to his disorderly ways of life, and he,
unable to alter them, "cast her off, having spent
the marriage money." She returned to Lincolnshire,
he to London, and they never met again. That
Greene, however, had felt within himself what it is to
be a father is shown by the exquisite "lullaby" he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
composed shortly after for Sephestia in his "Menaphon."
It is the well-known song:</p>

<p>In London he continued a favourite: "For these
my vaine discourses [that is, his love novels] I was
beloved of the more vainer sort of people, who being
my continuall companions came still to my lodging,
and there would continue quaffing, corowsing, and
surfeting with me all the day long." One of his
best friends has corroborated his statement, giving at
the same time a graphic description of his physical
appearance: "Hee inherited more vertues than vices,"
wrote Nash, "a jolly long red peake [beard] like the
spire of a steeple he cherisht continually, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
cutting, whereat a man might hang a jewell, it was so
sharp and pendant ... He had his faultes ... Debt
and deadly sinne, who is not subject to?... A good
fellow he was ... In a night and a day would he have
yarkt up a pamphlet as well as in seaven yeare, and glad
was that printer that might bee so blest to pay him
deare for the very dregs of his wit. He made no
account of winning credite by his workes ... His
only care was to have a spel in his purse to conjure up
a good cuppe of wine with at all times."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The few samples that have come to us of the talk
in these meetings of Elizabethan literary men show, as
might well have been supposed, that it was not lacking
in freedom. Greene himself has left an account of one
of these conversations, when he expressed, Bohemia-wise,
his opinions of a future life and, without Aucassin's
extenuating plea that he was love-mad, he exclaimed:
"Hell, quoth I, what talke you of hell to me? I know
if I once come there, I shall have the company of better
men than my selfe; I shall also meete with some madde
knaves in that place, and so long as I shall not sit there
alone, my care is the lesse. But you are mad folks,
quoth I, for if I feared the judges of the Bench no
more than I dread the judgments of God, I would
before I slept dive into one carles bagges or other, make
merrie with the shelles I found in them so long as they
would last."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>His associations at that time were getting lower and
lower. He was leaving Bohemia for the mysterious
haunts of robbers, sharpers, loose women, and "conny-catchers."
He had once for a mistress the sister of a
famous thief nicknamed Cutting Ball that ended his
days on the gallows, and he had a child by her, called
Fortunatus, who died in 1593. He thought it a sort
of atonement to communicate to the public the experience
he derived from his life among these people,
and accordingly printed a series of books on "conny-catching,"
in which he unveiled all their tricks and
malpractices. The main result was that they wanted to
kill him.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>It was, in fact, too late to reform; all that was left for
him was to repent, an empty repentance that no deed
could follow. Though scarcely thirty his constitution
was worn out. The alternations of excessive cheer and
of scanty food had ruined his health; it was soon obvious
that he could not live much longer. One day a "surfet
which hee had taken with drinking"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> brought him
home to his room, in a poor shoemaker's house, who
allowed him to stay there by charity on credit. He was
not to come out alive. His illness lasted some weeks,
and as his brain power was unimpaired he employed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
time in writing the last of his autobiographical pamphlets.
Considering the extravagance of his life, in which
he had known so many successes, and the sorrows of his
protracted illness, they read very tragically indeed. He
addressed himself to the public at large, to his more
intimate friends, to his wife confessing his wrongs
towards her, and asking pardon. Yet to the last,
broken as he was in body, he remained a literary man,
and while confessing all round and pardoning every one,
he could not drop his literary animosities nor forget his
life-long complaint against plagiarists.</p>

<p>His complaint was one of which the world of letters
was to hear much more in after time, and which in fact
is constantly renewed in our own day; it is the complaint
of the novelist against the dramatist, claiming as his
own incidents transferred by the playwright from readers
to spectators. As novels proper were just beginning
then in England, and as drama was also beginning to
spread, Greene's protest is one of the first on record,
and thousands were to follow it. Strange to say of all
the men of whom he complains, the one he has picked
out to hold up to disdain and to scorn, and towards
whom in his dying days he seems to have entertained
the strongest animosity, was a young man of twenty-eight,
who was just then becoming known, and whose
fame was to increase somewhat in after years, namely,
William Shakespeare. Greene beseeches the three
principal friends he still had, Marlowe, Nash, and
Peele, to cease writing plays; what is the good of it?
others come, turn to account what has been written before
them, give never a thank-you for it, and get the praise.
Let them stop publishing and these new-comers, among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
them this "upstart" Shakespeare, unable as they obviously
are to invent anything, will have their careers cut short.
Be warned by my fate, says Greene, and mind "those
puppits ... that speake from our mouths, those anticks
garnisht in our colours. Is it not strange that I, to
whom they al have been beholding: is it not like
that you to whome they all have been beholding, shall
(were ye in that case that I am now) be both at once
of them forsaken? Yes, trust them not, for there is
an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with
his <i>Tigers heart wrapt in a players hide</i>, supposes he is
as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best
of you; and being an absolute <i>Joannes fac totum</i>, is in
his owne conceit the onely shake-scene in a countrie.
O that I might intreate your rare wits to be imployed
in more profitable courses: and let those apes imitate
your past excellence and never more acquaint them with
your rare inventions."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>This savage abuse of young Shakespeare, who had
probably mended at that time more plays than we
know, and more, surely, than he had personally written,
must not pass without the needful comment that his
abuser was, according to his own testimony, as ready,
for a trifle, to make an acquaintance and start a friendship
as to turn a friend into a foe. "Though," says he, "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
knew how to get a friend, yet I had not the gift or reason
how to keepe a friend." He quarrelled, in fact, with
most of them, not excepting Nash and Marlowe, to whom
he is now appealing against Shakespeare; and his prefaces
contain numerous attacks on the writers of the
time. It must be remembered, too, how bitter was the
end of poor Greene, how keenly he felt, he the boon
companion <i>par excellence</i>, finding himself "forsaken"
in his need, and left alone in the shoemaker's desolate
room. It is curious to think that among the men
whose absence from his bedside he most resented was
Shakespeare, and that this want of a visit whetted his
already ill-disposed mind into expressing the only abuse
known to have been directed by his contemporaries
against the author of "Hamlet."</p>

<p>Shakespeare, of course, did not answer;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> his plea
might have been that if he did not pay much attention
to others' authorship, much less did he pay to his own;
for he never published his own dramas, nor did he
protest when mangled versions of them were circulated
by printers. He only showed that Greene's criticisms
had not much affected him by turning later on another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of the complainer's novels into a drama. Shakespeare's
friend, Ben Jonson, who was not accustomed to so
much reserve, speaks very disparagingly of Greene; he
represents him as being a perfectly forgotten author in
1599, which was untrue, and as for the particular work
in which Shakespeare was abused, he describes it as only
fit for the reading of crazy persons.</p>

<p>"<i>Trusty.</i> ... Every night they read themselves
asleep on those books [one of the two being the
"Groats-worth"].</p>

<p>"<i>Epicoene.</i> Good faith it stands with good reason. I
would I knew where to procure those books.</p>

<p>"<i>Morose.</i> Oh!</p>

<p>"<i>Sir Amorous La Foole.</i> I can help you with one of
them, mistress Morose, the 'Groats-worth of wit.'</p>

<p>"<i>Epicoene.</i> But I shall disfurnish you, Sir Amorous,
can you spare it?</p>

<p>"<i>La Foole.</i> O yes, for a week or so; I shall read it
myself to him," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>With the exception just mentioned, Greene's thoughts
were all turned to repentance. He had the consolation
of receiving from his wife a kindly message on the eve
of his death, "whereat hee greatly rejoiced, confessed that
he had mightily wronged her, and wished that hee
might see her before he departed. Whereupon, feeling
his time was but short, hee tooke pen and inke and
wrote her a letter to this effect:</p>

<p>"Sweet wife, as ever there was any good will or
friendship betweene thee and mee, see this bearer (my
host) satisfied of his debt: I owe him tenne pound, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
but for him I had perished in the streetes. Forget and
forgive my wronges done unto thee, and Almighty God
have mercie on my soule. Farewell till we meet in
heaven, for on earth thou shalt never see me more.
This 2d of September, 1592. Written by thy dying
husband."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>He died a day after.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Greene's non-dramatic works are the largest contribution
left by any Elizabethan writer to the novel
literature of the day. They are of four sorts: his
novels proper or romantic love stories, which he called
his love pamphlets; his patriotic pamphlets; his conny-catching
writings, in which he depicts actual fact,
and tells tales of real life forshadowing in some degree
Defoe's manner; lastly, his Repentances, of which some
idea has already been given.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>His love pamphlets, which filled the greatest part of
his literary career, connect him with the euphuistic
cycle, and he is assuredly one of Lyly's legatees. Possessing
a much greater fertility of invention than Lyly, he
follows as closely as the original bent of his mind allows
him, the manner of his master. He is euphuistic in his
style, wise in his advice to his readers, and a great
admirer of his own country.</p>

<p>His moral propensities do not lie concealed behind
pretty descriptions or adventures; they are stamped on
the very first page of each of his books and are expressly
mentioned in their titles. In this too, like his master
Lyly, he may be considered a precursor of Richardson.
He writes his "Mamillia" to entreat gentlemen to
beware how, "under the perfect substaunce of pure
love, [they] are oft inveigled with the shadowe of lewde
luste;" his "Myrrour of Modestie" to show "howe the
Lorde delivereth the innocent from all imminent perils
and plagueth the bloudthirstie hypocrites with deserved
punishments." "Euphues his censure to Philautus"
teaches "the vertues necessary in every gentleman;"
"Pandosto" shows that "although by the meanes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sinister fortune truth may be concealed, yet by Time
in spight of fortune, it is most manifestly revealed."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Quiet, wealthy, comfortable Richardson had no better
aim, and had, in fact, a very similar one, when he wrote
his "Pamela," as he is careful to state on the title-page,
"in order to cultivate the principles of virtue and
religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes;" and
his "Clarissa," to show "the distresses that may attend
the misconduct both of parents and children in relation
to marriage." Be it said to the praise of both authors
and readers, this moral purpose so prominently stated
did not in the least frighten the public of ladies, whose
suffrage, the two men, different as they were in most
things, were especially courting. Richardson's popularity
among them needs not to be recalled, and as for
Greene, he was stated at the time of his greater vogue
to be nothing less than "the Homer of women."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Greene's praise of England is as constant as Lyly's;
he is careful to show that whatever appearances may
be, he is proud to be a citizen of London, not, after
all, of Bohemia; if he represents himself shipwrecked
near the coast of an island where, like Robinson Crusoe,
he is alone able to swim, finding the country pleasant,
he describes it as "much like that faire England the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
flower of Europe."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Euphues' praise of London is
matched by Greene's description of its naval power in
his "Royal Exchange": "Our citizens of London (Her
Majesties royal fleet excepted) have so many shyppes
harboured within the Thames as wyll not onelie match
with all the argosies, galleyes, galeons and pataches in
Venice, but to encounter by sea with the strongest cittie
in the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> As for foreign women, Greene
agrees with Lyly that they all paint their faces, and
cannot live without a lover. French women, for
example, are "beautifull," it is true, but "they have
drugges of Alexandria, minerals of Egypt, waters from
Tharsus, paintings from Spaine, and what to doe forsooth?
To make them more beautifull then vertuous
and more pleasing in the eyes of men then delightful
in the sight of God.... Some take no pleasure but in
amorous passions, no delight but in madrigals of love,
wetting Cupid's wings with rose water, and tricking up
his quiver with sweete perfumes."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>But Greene's style marked him most indelibly as a
pupil of Lyly. He has taken Euphues' ways of speech
with all their peculiarities, and has sometimes crowded
his tales with such a quantity of similes, metaphors and
antitheses as to beat his master himself on his own
ground.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Here, again, we are in the middle of scorpions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>crocodiles, dipsas, and what not. Take, for
instance, "Philomela the lady Fitzwaters nightingale;"<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
as it is written expressly for ladies, and dedicated to one
of them, and as, in addition, the characters are of
high rank, the novel is nearly one unbroken series of
similes: "The greener
the alisander leaves be,
the more bitter is the
sappe," says Philip,
the jealous husband,
to himself; "the salamander
is most warm
when it lyeth furthest
from the fire;" thus
his wife may well be
as heart-hollow as she
seems lip-holy. He
charges his friend
Lutesio to tempt her,
by way of trial.
"Lutesio," the lady
replies to the young
man's declaration,
"now I see, the
strongest oake hath
his sap and his worms [and] that ravens will breed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in the fayrest ash." These observations appear unanswerable
to Lutesio, and the husband would share
his conviction if he did not reflect that "the onix is
inwardly most cold, when it is outwardly most hot."
The experiment must be tried again, and the friend
returns to the charge: "Madam, I have been stung
with the scorpion and cannot be helpt or healed by
none but by the scorpion."</p>

<p>"I see now," replies the lady to this compliment,
"that hemlocke wheresoever it bee planted, will be
pestilent [and] that the serpent with the brightest scales
shroudeth the most fatall venome." Is there anything
more certain? But that does not prevent the halcyon
from hatching when the sea is calm, and the ph&#339;nix
from spreading her wings when the sunbeams shine on
her nest. This is what the husband remarks, and,
guided by the onyx, the alexander, &amp;c., after a mock
trial, he divorces his wife.</p>

<p>What did the people think of it? They thought "all
was not golde that glistered, ... that the Agate, bee
it never so white without, yet it is full of black strokes
within."</p>

<p>During this time, Philomela, the wife who had been
driven away, retires to Palermo, where her knowledge
of natural history allows her to observe that the more
the camomile is trodden on, the faster it grows.
Scarcely separated from her, the husband loses his
confidence in the onyx and alexander, and sets out in
search of her. He does not know her place of retreat,
but, happily, among all possible routes, he chooses
precisely that leading to Palermo. He finds his wife
again, and his joy is so great that he is choked by it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and dies; a just punishment for his confidence in Lyly's
botany.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In the same way as patient Grisell's story had been
in the same period transferred to the stage, this new
example of feminine virtue, from the pen of the
"Homer of women," was, in later years, worked into
a drama. At that time Greene had long been dead
and could not complain of the new "shake-scene"
tortures inflicted upon him by Davenport.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>This story, characteristic as it is of Greene's style
when he means to be euphuistic, can scarcely be taken
as a fair sample of the improbability he is able to
crowd into a single novel. Most of his tales (and
in this he greatly differs from Lyly) take place
we do not know when, we do not know where,
among men we have never anywhere come across.
Learned as he was, versed in the Greek, Latin,
French and Italian tongues, able to translate passages
from the Italian of Ariosto, to dress in English language
the charming "D&eacute;bat de Folie et d'Amour"<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of
Louise Lab&eacute;, to imitate (as he thought) Cicero's style,
while describing (as he thought) the great orator's
loves,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> his turn of mind was as little critical as can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
imagined, and his wide popularity served to spread
geographical and historical absurdities, some of which
were preserved by Shakespeare himself, for the
amusement of a learned posterity. Greene's picture of
Ulysses' Penelope is not more Greek than the exquisite
painting by Pinturicchio at the National Gallery, where
the wise king of Ithaca appears under the guise of a
red-hosed Italian youth with flowing hair; while his wife
sits at her "web" in a Florentine blue dress. In Greene,
Penelope is represented telling stories to while away the
time, which, unless we endow her with a prophetical
gift, are impossibilities. Her first story begins thus:
"Saladyne the Souldan of &AElig;gipt, who by his prowesse
had made a generall conquest of the south-east part of
ye world tooke to wife Barmenissa, the onely daughter
and heire of the great chan." No wonder that such
tales could chain the attention and awaken the curiosity
of her maids, and keep them quiet till the time when
"a messenger came hastily rushing in, who tolde Penelope
that Ulisses was arryved that night within the port
of Ithaca.... Penelope called for her sonne and that
night sent him post to the sea."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Not less wonderful are the stories of "Arbasto,"
King of Denmark, or of "Pandosto," King of Bohemia.
They may be taken as typical specimens of the sort of
romantic novel the Elizabethan public enjoyed, and
which was sure to make an author popular. We must
remember when reading these tales that they were the
fashion, the craze, at a time when "Midsummer Night's
Dream" and "Romeo and Juliet" were being played.
Chaotic, improbable, and in some parts ridiculous as
they appear to us, they would have made their author
wealthy if anything could, so much so that, as we have
seen, the publishers, according to Nash, considered
themselves "blest to pay Greene deare for the very
dregs of his wit." He was, if anything, an author that
sold. What were his wares?</p>

<p>In "Arbasto" Greene represents himself reaching in
his travels the island of Candia. He meets in a cell a
solitary old man, and without any ceremony makes bold
to ask him for his story. The old man is at first somewhat
shocked at this inquisitiveness, and gets very
angry; but he grows calmer and complies. He is
Arbasto, late King of Denmark, and was once very
happy: "I feared not the force of forraigne foes, for I
knewe none but were my faithfull friends," says he, in
a style that reminds one of the King Herod of miracle-plays.
Living in such content, he thought it advisable
to invade France, where at that time a king was reigning,
named Pelorus, about whom chroniclers are silent.
Arbasto came straight to Orleans, and after some siege
operations, "had so shaken the walles with cannon shot,
that they were forced to strengthen them with counter
mures."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>A three months' truce is agreed to on both sides,
and the two sovereigns entertain each other. At the
French court, Arbasto meets the two daughters of the
king, Myrania and Doralicia, two wonderful creatures,
especially the latter, who was "so adorned with more
then earthlie perfection as she seemed to be framed by
nature to blemishe nature, and that beautie had skipt
beyond her skil in framing a peece of such curious
workemanship." Arbasto cannot cease gazing at her;
he addresses to himself euphuistic speeches several pages
long, but they do him no good. It so happens that
while his love is set on Doralicia, the other princess
falls in love with him. But this again does him no
good. He ceases to find anything worth living for;
even the possible destruction of France seems to him
tasteless. His nobles observe his changed mood, and
wonder, and his confidant, Duke Egerio, vainly tries
on him the effect of a new series of euphuistic examples
and similes. Arbasto continues loving, and Doralicia
perseveres in her coldness; they meet once, and argue
one against the other with the help of salamanders and
scorpions, and empty their whole herbaria over each
other's head; but things remain <i>in statu</i>.</p>

<p>King Pelorus, who, for all that, does not lose his
head, offers Arbasto an interview in Orleans to sign
the peace. Arbasto comes, the gates are shut, he is
thrown into prison; his army is cut to pieces, and a
great scaffold is erected in a conspicuous place, on which
the prisoner is to be publicly executed in ten days'
time.</p>

<p>The royal Dane tries to console himself in his prison
with what remains of his herbarium and zoology. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
better help comes in the shape of the loving princess,
Myrania, who is resolved to save him. By her command
her maid entices the gaoler to her room, and
causes him to tread "upon a false bord" that had apparently
been there in all times, ready for this very
emergency. The gaoler falls "up to the shoulders;"
then he disappears into a hole, where he dies, and his
keys are taken from him.</p>

<p>Arbasto is very happy, and promises Myrania to love
and marry her; they go "covertly out of the citie,
passing through France with many fearefull perils"
and reach Denmark. Pelorus and Doralicia are extremely
angry; she even takes to "blaspheming ... but
as words breake no bones, so we cared the lesse for
her scolding."</p>

<p>But Arbasto learns to his cost that no man when
truly in love can cease to love as he pleases. Before
keeping his word to Myrania he wants once more to
appeal to her fair sister. But the fair sister continues
in her blaspheming mood, and sends a very sharp and
contemptuous answer.</p>

<p>Both letters fall into the hands of Myrania, who is
so struck by this piece of treachery that she dies of her
sorrow; hearing which Pelorus rather unexpectedly
dies of his sorrow for her death. Doralicia then is
queen, and at last discovers that in the innermost part
of her heart there is love for Arbasto. She writes
accordingly, but the Dane this time returns a contemptuous
answer. Receiving which, the poor French
queen dies of her sorrow. And thereupon, for no apparent
reason, except to add yet more sorrow to the
conclusion of this tragical tale, the confidant of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Danish king turns traitor, usurps his crown, and
Arbasto goes to Candia, where Greene had the good
fortune to hear from his own lips this wondrous and
authentic tale. "Merry and tragical! tedious and
brief!" as Duke Theseus would think.</p>

<p>However complete the success awarded to Arbasto's
adventures, it was nothing compared with the popularity
of "Pandosto." If this was not the best it was
the most famous of Greene's tales. The plot is well
known, for Shakespeare, unmoved by the dying maledictions
of his late companion, drew from it the
materials of his "Winter's Tale" (1611?). He kept
many of the improbabilities of Greene, rejected a few,
and added some of his own. But the great change he
made was to give life to the heroes, and as they had
been shaped by Greene they sorely needed it. Rarely
did a more unlikely and a cruder tale come from the
pen of our novelist.</p>

<p>The events of the story take place among kings and
shepherds: "In the countrey of Bohemia there raygned
a king called Pandosto." This is the usual beginning
of novels of the time; hundreds of them commence in
this manner;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> the very first lines transport the reader
to an unknown country, and place him before an
unknown king, and if, after reading only those few
words, he is surprised to find himself entangled in
extraordinary, inexplicable adventures, he must be of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a very na&iuml;ve disposition. But in Elizabethan times
adventures were liked for their own sake; probability
was only a very secondary motive of enjoyment.
"Pandosto," in any case, deserves our attention, for,
if it commenced like many other novels of the time, it
led, as we have said, to "Winter's Tale," to which it is
worth while to go. When the two are read together
and compared, it seems as if Shakespeare had chosen
on purpose one of the worst of Greene's tales, to show
by way of an answer to the accusations of the dead
writer, that he was able to form something out of
nothing. Greene had, in truth, only modelled the
clay; Shakespeare used it, adding the soul.</p>

<p>Greene simply states his facts and takes little trouble
about explaining them; the reader must rest satisfied
with the author's bare word. There is no attempt at
the study of passions; his heroes change their minds
all of a sudden, with the stiff, sharp, improbable action
of puppets in a show. Pandosto (Leontes) loves and
hates, and becomes jealous, and repents always in the
same brusque wire-and-wood manner; the warmth of his
passions, so great and terrible in Shakespeare, is here
simply absent; when he begins to suspect his friend
Egistus (Polixenes) of feeling an unlawful love for
Bellaria (Hermione), we are barely informed that the
Bohemian king "concluded at last to poyson him."
When Dorastus and Fawnia (Florizel and Perdita)
seek refuge in Pandosto's kingdom, Pandosto at once
falls in love with his own daughter, Fawnia, whom
he does not know; then on the receipt of a letter
from Egistus, "having his former love turned to a
disdainful hate," he wishes to have her killed. Very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
differently is the couple received by Shakespeare's
Leontes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Were I but twenty-one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your father's image is so hit in you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His very air, that I should call you brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I did him; and speak of something wildly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By us performed before. Most dearly welcome!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, fair princess, goddess!&mdash;O, alas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might thus have stood, begetting wonder as<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You gracious couple do."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Greene the exquisite figure of Perdita appears as
a very rough sketch under the name of Fawnia. She
loves her Dorastus not merely because he is lovable,
but because "hoping in time to be advaunced from
the daughter of a poore farmer to be the wife of a
riche king." Dorastus comes to her disguised as a
shepherd, and as she does not recognize him "she
began halfe to forget Dorastus and to favor this
prety shepheard whom she thought shee might both
love and obtaine." It would be cruel to make further
comparisons, but it is necessary to say thus much
in order to show what a hold adventures, however
crude, surprises, unexpected meetings and recognitions,
had upon Elizabethan minds. They were quite sufficient
to insure success; to add life and poetry was very
well, but by no means necessary. Shakespeare did so
because he could not do otherwise; and he did it
thoroughly, as was his wont, endowing with his life-giving
faculty the most insignificant personage he found
embryo-like in Greene. The least of them has, in
Shakespeare, his own moods, his sensitiveness, a mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and a heart that is his and his alone; even young
Mamillius, the child who lives only the length of one
scene, is not any child, but tells his tale, his sad tale,
with a grace that is all his own.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"A sad tale's best for winter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... I will tell it softly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yond crickets shall not hear it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Living people, too, are his Paulina, his Antigonus,
his Camillo, his Autolycus, all of them additions of his
own creation. Living also, his shepherds, for whom he
received only insignificant hints from Greene. In
"Pandosto" we hear of "a meeting of all the farmers
daughters in Sycilia," without anything more, and from
this Shakespeare drew the idea of his sheep-shearing
feast, where he delights in contrasting with the rough
ways of his peasants the inborn elegance of Perdita:
"O Proserpina," says she, in her delicious mythological
prattle:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For the flowers now, that, frighted, thou lett'st fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Dis's wagon! daffodils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That come before the swallow dares ..."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Florizel, wondering at her with his young
admiring eyes, answers in the same strain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"When you speak, sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd have you do it ever; when you sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd have you buy and sell so; so give alms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing but that."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Very different is the old shepherd's tone; though
kindly, it is quite conformable to his estate and
situation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would sing her song, and dance her turn; now here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his shoulder and his; her face o' fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With labour, and the thing she took to quench it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would to each one sip. You are retired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if you were a feasted one, and not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hostess of the meeting."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Never has the language of country people been
better transferred to literature; their manners, tone, and
language in Shakespeare have remained true to nature
even to the present day, so much so that it is difficult,
while writing, not to think of harvest and vintage
scenes, which every year brings round again in
our French valleys, and the sort of kindly talk very
similar to the old shepherd's that many of us remember,
as well as I do, to have heard in the country, from
peasant associates in early days. This unsurpassed
fidelity to nature is the more remarkable as it dates
from the Arcadian times of English literature, days
that were to last long, even down to the time of
Pope and of Thomson himself, to stop at Burns,
when at last a deeper, if not truer, note was to be
struck.</p>

<p>But with regard to mere facts, Shakespeare was in no
way more careful than Greene, and he seems to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
known, and it was in fact visible enough, the greediness
of his public to be such that, ostrich like, they
would swallow anything. He, therefore, changed very
little. In Greene, ships "sail into Bohemia," a feat that
cannot be repeated to-day; the Queen is tried by a jury
"panelled" for that purpose; the nobles go "to the
isle of Delphos, there to enquire of the oracle of
Apollo whether she had committed adultery." Very
much the same things happen in Shakespeare. The
survival of Hermione is his own invention; in Greene
she dies for good at the beginning of the novel, when
she hears of the death of her son. With the same
aptitude to die for no other cause than to improve a
story, Pandosto dies also in Greene's tale: he remembered
his faults and "fell in a melancholie fit, and to
close up the comedie with a tragicall stratageme he
slewe himselfe." Merry and tragical! But otherwise
Dorastus and Fawnia would have had to wait before
becoming king and queen, and such a waiting was
against the taste of the time and the rules of novel
writing.</p>

<p>Such as it is, Greene's tale had an extraordinary
success. While Shakespeare's drama was not printed,
either in authentic or pirated shape, before the
appearance of the 1623 folio, the prose story had a
number of editions throughout the seventeenth century
and even, under one shape or another, throughout the
eighteenth. It was printed as a chap-book during this
last period, and in this costume began a new life. It
was turned into verse in 1672, under the title, "Fortune's
tennis ball: or the most excellent history of
Dorastus and Fawnia, rendred into delightful english<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
verse";<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> it begins with this "delightful" invocation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Inspire me gentle love and jealousie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me thy passion and thy extasie,<br /></span>

<p>But the highest and most extraordinary compliment
to Greene's performance was its translation into French,
not only once, as has been said, but twice. The first
time was at a moment when the English language and
literature were practically unknown and as good as non-extant
to French readers. It appeared in 1615, and
was dedicated to "tr&egrave;s haute and tr&egrave;s illustre princesse,
Madame Christine S&#339;ur du Roy."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The second translation,
that has never yet been noticed, was made at
a time when France had a novel literature of its own
well worth reading, and when Boileau had utterly routed
and discomfited the writers of romantic and improbable
tales. Nevertheless, it was thought that a public would
be found in Paris for Greene's novel, and it was printed
accordingly in French in 1722, this time adorned with
engravings.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> They show "Doraste" dressed as a marquis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>of Louis XV.'s time; while "Pandolphe" wears
a flowing wig under his cocked hat, and sits on a throne
in rococo style. A copy of the book was purchased
for the royal library, and is still to be seen at the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris, with the crown and
cipher of his Most Christian Majesty on the cover.</p>

<p>Greene's story of "Menaphon"<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> is hardly more
probable, but it takes place in the country of Arcadia,
a fact that predisposes us to treat with indulgence any
lack of reality; moreover, it contains touches of true
poetry, and is perhaps, all considered, the best of Greene's
romantic novels. In common with most of this author's
tales it abounds in monologues and dialogues; heroes
think aloud and let us into their secret thoughts, a
device adapted from the classic drama and very common
in all the English novels of the period. There is also,
according to Greene's custom, a great abundance of songs
and verses, the best piece being the lullaby quoted above.
Propriety and the truth of characters are not much
better observed here than in Greene's other stories.
Everybody in this romance speaks with infinite grace and
politeness. The shepherd Menaphon, introducing himself
to the Princess Sephestia and her child, who have been
cast ashore through a shipwreck, says to them:
"Strangers, your degree I know not, therefore pardon
if I give lesse title than your estates merit." And,
falling desperately in love with the beautiful young
woman, who gives as her name Samela of the island of
Cyprus, he describes to her with ardour and not without
grace the pastoral life that he would like to lead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with her: "I tell thee, faire nymph, these plaines that
thou seest stretching southward, are pastures belonging
to Menaphon: ther growes the cintfoyle, and the
hyacinth, the cowsloppe, the primrose and the violet,
which my flockes shall spare for flowers to make thee
garlands, the milke of my ewes shall be meate for thy
pretie wanton, the wool of the fat weathers that seemes
as fine as the fleece that Jason fet from Colchos, shall
serve to make Samela webbes withall; the mountaine
tops shall be thy mornings walke, and the shadie valleies
thy evenings arbour: as much as Menaphon owes
shall be at Samelas command if she like to live with
Menaphon."</p>

<p>The romance goes on its way, strewn with songs
whose refrains of varied and tuneful metres afford
charming melody. In the end two knights, Melicertus
and Pleusidippus, both enamoured of Sephestia, fight a
duel; they are separated. The king of the country
interferes, and comprehending nothing of these intricate
love affairs, he is on the point of cutting off all their
heads, when it is discovered that Melicertus is the long
lost husband of Sephestia; the other duellist is the child
of the shipwrecked woman, who, in the course of the
tale, has been stolen from her on the shore and has
grown up in hiding. They embrace one another; and,
as for Menaphon, whose sweetheart finds herself thus
provided with a sufficiently fond husband and son, he
returns to his old love, Pesana, who had had patience to
wait for him, doubtless without growing old: for, in
these romances, people do not grow old. Pleusidippus
has become a man, without the least change in his
mother's face; she has remained as beautiful as in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
first page of the book, and is, according to appearances,
still "sweet-and-twenty."</p>

<p>In his tales of this sort Greene was mostly
describing delights with which he was not personally
acquainted, lands of which he had no practical knowledge,
princely adventures for which no historian could
vouch. He was perfectly free and unimpeded. The
taste of the public was similar to his; no Boileau was
there to stop him, and he wrote accordingly, following
his fancy, not caring in the least for nature and possibility,
letting his pen go as fast as it would, and turning
out "in a night and a day" a tale like his "Menaphon."
But if he did not choose to paint from life and to
describe realities in his "love pamphlets," he did so on
purpose, not because he was unable to do it. In several
of his other writings his subject was such that the work
would have been nothing if not true; and there we
find a clear view of human passions, foibles and
peculiarities, which show that if the taste of the
romance readers of the time had been such as to
encourage him in this line, he would have proved no
mean realistic novelist. His Repentances abound in
portraits and scenes, showing the keen eye he had for
realities. His conny-catching literature is full of exact
descriptions of the sordid life of the sharpers and
low courtesans of Elizabethan London. In more
than one of these pamphlets he foreshadows, though
I need not say with a much lesser genius, the "Moll
Flanders" and the "Colonel Jack" of a later period.
The resemblance is especially great in the "Life and
death of Ned Browne,"<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> in which the hero, according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the custom in picaresque novels, of which more hereafter,
himself tells his own story in the first person.
Greene is particularly bitter in his denunciations of the
professional courtesans of London, about whom he knew
probably more than any of his contemporaries. But
with all the hatred he felt towards them so long as he
had pen in hand, he cannot help repeating that, however
objectionable they are in many ways, they have for
themselves this advantage, that they are extremely
beautiful, so that if their morals are exactly the same as
in other countries they excel at least in something which
in itself is not contemptible. They are "a kinde of
women bearing the faces of Angels, but the hearts of
devils, able to intrap the elect if it were possible."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Greene had no pretension to be one of the elect, and
was only too often "intraped"; but for all his miseries
his words show a scarcely less intense admiration for his
diabolical angels than Des Grieux's famous rapturous
phrase when he meets Manon on her way to the ship
that is to convey her to America: "Son linge &eacute;tait sale
et d&eacute;rang&eacute;; ses mains d&eacute;licates expos&eacute;es &agrave; l'injure de
l'air; enfin tout ce compos&eacute; charmant, <i>cette figure
capable de ramener l'univers &agrave; l'idolatrie</i>, paraissait
dans un d&eacute;sordre et un abattement inexprimables."
"Again," writes Greene: "let me say this much, that
our curtizans ... are far superiour in artificiall allurement
to them of all the world, for, although they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
not the painting of Italie, nor the charms of France,
nor the jewelles of Spaine, yet they have in their eyes
adamants that wil drawe youth as the jet the strawe....
Their lookes ... containe modesty, mirth, chastity,
wantonness and what not."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Besides the personal reminiscences with which he
made up his repentance tales and stories, Greene as an
observer of human nature is seen at his best in his
curious, and at the time famous, dialogue "between
velvet breeches and cloth breeches."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> It is in fact
a disputation between old England and new England;
the England that built the strong houses praised by
Harrison, and the England that adorned itself with the
Burghley House paper work; traditional England and
italianate England. Velvet breeches is "richly daubde
with gold, and poudred with pearle," and is "sprung
from the auncient Romans, borne in Italy, the mistresse
of the worlde for chivalry." Cloth breeches is of
English manufacture and descent, and deplores the
vices that have crept into "this glorious Iland" in
the wake of Italian fashions. Both plead before
Greene, each giving very graphic accounts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
behaviour of the other. Here, for example, is a
scene, assuredly from the life, at a barber's shop:</p>

<p>"Velvet breeches he sittes downe in the chaire
wrapt in fine cloathes ... then comes [the barber]
out with his fustian eloquence, and making a low
conge, saith:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img31.jpg" width="400" height="353" alt="velvet breeches and cloth breeches, 1592." title="" />
<span class="caption">velvet breeches and cloth breeches, 1592.</span>
</div>

<p>"Sir, will you have your wor[ship's] haire cut
after the Italian maner, shorte and round, and then
frounst with the curling yrons, to make it looke like
a halfe moone in a miste? or like a Spanyard, long at
the eares and curled like the two endes of an old cast
periwig? or will you be Frenchified, with a love locke
downe to your shoulders, wherein you may weare
your mistresse favour? The English cut is base and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
gentlemen scorne it, novelty is daintye; speake the woord
sir, and my sissars are ready to execute your worships
wil.</p>

<p>"His head being once drest, which requires in
combing and rubbing some two howers, hee comes to
the bason: then being curiously washt with no woorse
then a camphire bal, he descends as low as his berd,
and asketh whether he please to be shaven or no,
whether he will have his peak cut short and sharpe,
amiable like an <i>inamorato</i>, or broad pendant like a
spade, to be terrible like a warrior and a Soldado ...
if it be his pleasure to have his appendices primed or his
mustachios fostered to turn about his eares like ye
branches of a vine...."</p>

<p>The question pending between cloth and velvet is
submitted to a jury; men of the various professions are
called and accepted, or rejected, according to their
merit; each is described, often in a very lively manner.
Here is, for example, the portrait of a poet or rather of
<i>the</i> poet of the Elizabethan period; for the specimen
here represented stands as a type for all his class; and
it is worth notice, for if Shakespeare himself was
different, many of his associates at the "Mermaid,"
we may be sure, well answered the description. "I
espied far off a certain kind of an overworne gentleman,
attired in velvet and satin; but it was somewhat
dropped and greasie, and bootes on his legges, whose
soles wexed thin and seemed to complaine of their
maister, which treading thrift under his feet, had
brought them unto that consumption. He walked
not as other men in the common beaten way, but came
compassing <i>circumcirca</i>, as if we had beene divells and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
he would draw a circle about us, and at every third
step he looked back as if he were afraid of a baily or
a sarjant." Cloth Breeches, who seems to be describing
here Greene himself, is not too severe in his appreciation
of the character of the poor troubled fellow:
"If he have forty pound in his purse together, he
puts it not to usury, neither buies land nor merchandise
with it, but a moneths commodity of wenches and
capons. Ten pound a supper, why tis nothing if his
plough goes and his ink horne be cleere ... But to
speak plainely I think him an honest man if he would
but live within his compasse, and generally no mans
foe but his own. Therefore I hold him a man fit to be
of my jury."</p>

<p>Judgment is passed in favour of cloth England
against velvet England; and in this ultra-conservative
sentence the views of the Bohemian novelist are summed
up in this premature essay on the "philosophy of
clothes."</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The fame and success of Greene encouraged writers
to follow his example. He had shown that there was
a public for novels, and that it was a sort of literature
that would pay, both in reputation and money. He
had, therefore, many rivals and imitators who were
thus only second-hand disciples of Lyly. Among these
Nicholas Breton and Emmanuel Ford may be taken as
examples. Both were his contemporaries, but survived
him many years. In both traces of euphuism survive,
but they are faint; at the time they wrote euphuism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was on the wane, and it is only on rare occasions that
Ford reminds us that "the most mightie monarch
Alexander, aswel beheld the crooked counterfeit of
Vulcan as the sweet picture of Venus. Philip of
Macedon accepted...."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>What Ford especially imitated from Greene was the
art of writing romantic tales with plenty of adventures,
unexpected meetings and discoveries, much love, and
improbabilities enough to enchant Elizabethan readers
and sell the book up to any number of editions. In
this he rivalled his model very successfully, and his
romances were among the most popular of the time of
Shakespeare. The number of their editions was extraordinary,
and they were renewed at almost regular
intervals up to the eighteenth century; there was
a far greater demand for them than for any play of
Shakespeare.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Besides imitating Greene, who obviously
revealed to him the success to be won by writing
romantic tales, he imitated at the same time the
Italians and the Spaniards, introducing into his
romances a licentiousness quite unknown to Greene,
but well known to Boccaccio, and heroic adventures
similar to those his friend Anthony Munday was
just then putting into English. These last were
to be the chief delight of novel-readers in the seventeenth
century, and did more than anything for the
great popularity of Ford's novels during that period.</p>

<p>Ford's earliest and most characteristic work was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
called "Parismus, the renowned prince of Bohemia
... conteining his noble battailes fought against
the Persians ... his love to Laurana ... and his
straunge adventures in the desolate Iland," &amp;c., &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
As the title informs us there are loves and wars in this
romance, deeds of valour and of sorcery, there are
pageants and enchanters. The adventures take place
in purely imaginary lands, which the author is pleased
to call Bohemia, Persia, &amp;c., but which might have
been as well baptized Tartary or Mongolia. The
manners and costumes, however, when there is an
attempt at describing them, are purely Elizabethan.
There are masques such as were shown at court in
Shakespeare's time, and during one such f&ecirc;te, as in
"Romeo and Juliet," Parismus for the first time
declares his love to Laurana: "The maskers entred
in this sort: first entred two torch bearers, apparelled
in white satten, beset with spangles of gold, after
whom followed two Eunuches, apparelled all in greene,
playing on two instruments, then came Parismus attired
all in carnation satten ... next followed ... when came
two knights ... next followed ..."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and so on; in
the same style as in Shakespeare's play, "enter Romeo,
Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six maskers, torch-bearers
and others."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> But, alas, this is the only
place where there is any resemblance between the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
styles; though the situation developes under Ford's
pen in a manner to suggest that he must have read
"Romeo" not without a purpose. Had his purpose
been to show his contemporaries the height of
Shakespeare's genius by giving, side by side with
it, the measure of an ordinary mind, he could not
have tried better nor succeeded less. For contemporaries
and successors consumed innumerable
editions of "Parismus," and only too easily numbered
editions of "Romeo."</p>

<p>Parismus and Laurana talk, in the midst of the ball,
of their new-born love, and after an exchange of highly
polite phrases she thus confesses her feelings: "My
noble lord ... I heartily thanke you for taking so
much paines for my sake, being unwoorthie thereof,
and also unable to bee sufficiently thankfull unto you
for the same, and for that you say your happinesse
resteth in my power, if I can any way work your
content to the uttermost of my endeavour I will do
it." Parismus, of course, has nothing to answer except
that no one could require more.</p>

<p>It had been, however, with her also, love at first
sight; but Laurana does not say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go, ask his name: if he be married,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My grave is like to be my wedding bed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She is far too well bred and courtly, and she explains
as follows what she has felt: "My Lord, I assure you,
that at such time as I sawe you comming first into
this court, my heart was then surprised, procured, as
I think by the destinies, that ever since I have vowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to rest yours." This speech is made at a nightly
garden meeting, similar to the one where Romeo
went "with love's light wings," and where was heard
the sweetest and gravest lovers' music that ever
enchanted human ears:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"At lovers' perjuries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will frown and be perverse....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no joy of this contract to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere one can say, It lightens." ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He of Bohemia had not come with "love's light
wings," but "somewhat before the hour, was gone forth
in his night gowne, with his sworde under his arme,
and comming to the gate he was wont to goe in at into
the gardeine, found it shut, and having no other meanes,
he gott over the wall." We picture him clambering
over the wall, his night-gown flowing about him to do
duty for love's wings. The lovers meet, and "thus they
spent the night in kinde salutations and curteous imbracings
to the unspeakable joy and comfort of them
both."</p>

<p>To complete the external resemblance of the two
situations, there is in Ford's novel a young lord to play
the part of "County Paris." He is called Sicanus, and
Laurana's family greatly favours his suit: "Laurana,
my cheefest care is to see thee married, according to
thy state, which hath made me send for thee, to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
whether thou hast alreadie placed thy affection or no:
otherwise there is come into this country, a knight of
great estate," &amp;c., &amp;c. "Laurana departed with a heavie
heart."</p>

<p>Then again, as in "Romeo," there is another meeting
of the lovers, this time in Laurana's chamber; and they
spend the hours "in sweete greetings, but farre from
anie thought of unchastnesse, their imbracings being
grounded upon the most vertuous conditions that might
bee: and sitting together upon the beds side, Laurana
told him...." As in Romeo, they are parted by
morn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the nightingale, and not the lark....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;It was the lark, the herald of the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Yond light is not daylight...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very different morn shines in at Laurana's windows:
"Nowe the dismall houre of their parting being
approached, by reason of the light that the sunne began
to give into the chamber, Parismus taking Laurana in
his armes, drawing sweete breath from her lippes, told
her that now, to his greefe, he must leave her to be
courted by his enemie."</p>

<p>Without any very great grief on our side we shall
leave them to follow from this point a series of adventures
very different from Romeo's. Parismus becomes
a chief of outlaws, and acquires great fame under the
name of the Black Knight; he wages war against
Sicanus, he encounters young Violetta, and their meetings
read like a tale from Boccaccio rather than like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
play of Shakespeare; at last he marries Laurana "with
admirable pompe" in the "temple of Diana." We
shall leave them in this holy place, though many more
adventures are in store for them. We shall only state
that Ford, encouraged by the great success of this first
attempt, wrote several other novels exactly in the same
style, containing the same improbable monsters and
wonders, and the same licentious adventures. In spite,
however, of the condemnation he suffered at the hands
of wise people on account of the undeniable immorality
of several of his episodes, his reputation went on increasing
for years and long survived him.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Another follower of Greene was Nicholas Breton,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
eighteen years his senior; but he did not begin novel-writing
until after the death of his model, when this
kind of literature had taken a firm hold of the public.
Very little euphuism remains in Breton; we do not
find in him those clusters of similes with which Lyly
and Greene were fond of adorning their novels, and
alliteration is there only to remind us that through
Greene, Breton may be considered a secondary legatee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of Lyly. The subjects and the form of his writings,
much better than his style, prove him a pupil of
Greene. He imitated his dialogues, publishing in succession
his conference "betwixt a scholler and an angler,"
his discussion between "wit and will"; his disputation
of a scholar and a soldier, "the one defending learning,
the other martiall discipline," and several others on
travels, on court and country, &amp;c. He imitated
Greene's tales of low life, anticipating in his turn
Defoe's novels, with his "Miseries of Mavillia;" he remained,
however, far below the level not only of Defoe,
but of Greene, whose personal knowledge of the misfortunes
he was describing enabled him to give in his
writings of this kind pictures of reality that contrasted
strangely with the fanciful incidents of his romantic
novels. The only things worth remembering in these
"miseries," besides their subject, are a few thoughtful
observations such as the one (in alliterative style) which
opens the story: "Sorrow sokes long ere it slayes;
care consumes before it killes; and destinie drives the
body into much miserie, before the heart be strooken
dead;" a far juster observation than Greene's fancies,
according to which heroes of novels may be got rid of
as quickly by sorrow as by poison or apoplexy.</p>

<p>There are also in Breton imitations of the romantic
novel of Italian origin such as Greene understood it
and such as the Elizabethan public loved it. Breton
published in 1600 his "Strange fortunes of two excellent
princes," which his modern editor does not hesitate
to declare "a bright and characteristic little book."
This little masterpiece begins thus, in very characteristic
fashion indeed: "In the Ilandes of Balino, neere unto the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
city of Dulno, there lived a great duke named Firente.... This
lord had to wife a sweete ladie called Merilla,
a creature of much worth.... This blessed lord and
ladie had issue male, onlie one sonne named Penillo
and female one onlie daughter named Merilla." These
two children were famous for their wit and beauty.
"But I will ... entreat of another Duke, who dwelt
in the Ilands of Cotasie.... This duke had to name
Ordillo, a man famous for much worth as well in wit
as valour.... This duke had to wife a gratious ladie.... She
had by her lord the duke two blessed children,
a sonne and a daughter; her sonne named Fantiro and
her daughter Sinilla." These two children begat wonder
for their wit and their beauty.</p>

<p>Such is the introduction. What do you think will
follow? That the two perfect young men will marry
the two unique young women? This is exactly what
happens; and the only perceptible interest in the tale
is to see from what improbable incidents such likely
consequences are derived. We can safely, it seems,
class this novel in the same category as "Arbasto,"
"Mamillia," and other products of Greene's pen; not,
however, without remarking that Breton's stories, as well
as those of his model, were not meant to delight nurseries,
but were destined to give pleasure to grown-up people,
to people in society; they were offered them as
<i>jucunda oblivia vit&aelig;</i>, exactly in the same fashion as
the three-volume novels of to-day. Breton himself is
positive on this point, and he has been careful to inform
us that his intention was to write things "which being
read or heard in a winters evening by a good fire, or a
summers morning in the greene fields may serve both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to purge melancholy from the minde and grosse humours
from the body."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Again, he was connected with the Greene and Lyly
group by the pleasure he felt in composing imaginary
letters. A number of such letters had been inserted by
Lyly in his "Euphues," and had proved one of the attractions
of the book; Greene and the other novelists of
the period never missed an opportunity of making their
heroes write to each other, and they always transcribed
their letters in full, a process inherited from the romance
writers of the Middle Ages. Breton, following the
example already given by some of his contemporaries,
went beyond that, and published a volume of imaginary
letters from everybody to anybody on any subject, many
of them rather coarse, some good, some rather slow
in their gait and heavy in their wit.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The public taste<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
was so decidedly in favour of these compositions that
this was the most successful of Breton's enterprises. It
was often reprinted; a number of similar collections
were circulated in the seventeenth century, and their
popularity had not abated when Richardson was asked,
by the publishers Osborne and Rivington, to compose
one for country people. He did so, and the only
difference, and a sufficiently important one, was that in
his series the letters were connected by the thread of
a story.</p>

<p>Greene had a rival of much higher stature in his
friend Thomas Lodge. Lodge was a little older than
Greene, and survived him long, so that he happened to
be a contemporary both of Greene and of his imitators.
He rivalled Greene, but did not imitate him, being
himself a direct legatee of Lyly. The sort of life he
led differed greatly from that of his friend, but it was
scarcely less characteristic of the period. Lodge was
the son of a rich London grocer who had been Lord
Mayor. Born in 1557, he had known Lyly at Oxford;
had studied law; then, yielding to those desires of
seeing the dangers and beauties of the world which
drove the English youths of the period to seek preferment
abroad, he closed his books for a while, and became
a corsair, visiting the Canary Isles, Brazil, and Patagonia.
He brought back, as booty from his expeditions,
romances written at sea to beguile the tedium of the
passage and the anxieties of the tempest. One was
called "The Margarite of America"; another "Rosalynde."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>The latter fell into Shakespeare's hands and
pleased him; he drew from it the plot of "As you
like it."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Coming before the literary public, Lodge
does not altogether forget his profession of corsair,
and in order to deprive the critics of the temptation to
sneer, he is careful to brandish his rapier from time to
time, and to write prefaces that make one's hair stand
on end. "Roome for a souldier and a sailer, that gives
you the fruits of his labors that he wrote in the Ocean!"
he cries to the reader at the beginning of his "Rosalynde,"
and let fault-finders keep silence; otherwise he
will throw them overboard "to feed cods."</p>

<p>After such a warning there would be nothing it
seems but to hold our tongue; but perhaps, taking the
practical side of the question, we may consider that by
this time Lodge's rapier must have grown very rusty,
and would not offer more danger than any critic is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
bound to incur in the performance of his duty. Besides
that admiration may in all sincerity be blended with
criticism when it is a question of Lodge's masterpiece,
"Rosalynde."</p>

<p>The tale itself bears a somewhat curious history.
Twice at two hundred years' distance it took the fancy
of the greatest genius of the period. In the Middle
Ages it was called the "Tale of Gamelyn,"<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and Chaucer
apparently intended to work it into his "Canterbury
Tales," but he died before he had completed his wish,
and some copy of the rough old poem having, as it
seems, been found among his papers, it was in after
time inserted in the manuscripts of his works as the
"Cooke's Tale." As it stood in the fourteenth century
this story recited mere deeds of valour, of strong,
sinewy fighters; love and women played no part in it;
and it is a great loss for us not to know whether old
Chaucer would have made this very necessary addition,
and what sort of medi&aelig;val Rosalind he would have
depicted.</p>

<p>As things went, we are indebted to our gentleman
adventurer for the invention of Rosalind. Lodge took
up the tale and remodelled it entirely; he gave place
in it to the fair she-page and to her friend Alinda and
to Ph&#339;be, the hard-hearted shepherdess, in such a way
that when Shakespeare in his turn bethought himself of
this story, he had nothing to add to fit it for his own
stage, nothing except genius.</p>

<span class="caption">preparing for the hunt, 1575.</span>
</div>

<p>But if Lodge cannot be considered a man of genius,
he is certainly a writer of very remarkable gifts. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
novel is a pastoral tale that takes place somewhere
in France, near Bordeaux, and reads as pleasantly as any
story in "Astr&eacute;e," no mean compliment. Probability,
geography and chronology, are not Lodge's strong
points; we are in fact again in the country of nowhere,
in an imaginary kingdom of France over which the
usurper Torismond reigns. The true king has been
deposed and leads a forester's life, untroubled, unknown,
in the thick woods of Arden. Rosalind, a daughter of
the deposed king, has been kept as a sort of hostage at
the court of the tyrant in
Bordeaux, presumably his
capital. All of a sudden
she is exiled in her turn,
without more explanation
than "I have heard
of thy aspiring speaches
and intended treasons."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
Alinda, her friend, the
daughter of the tyrant,
refuses to leave her, and
both fly the court, Rosalind being dressed as a page,
a rapier at her side, her wit full of repartees, her
mind full of shifts, and equal, in fact, as in Shakespeare,
to any emergency. "Tush, quoth Rosalynd, art thou
a woman and hast not a sodaine shift to prevent a
misfortune? I, thou seest, am of a tall stature, and
would very well become the person and apparell of a
page; thou shalt bee my mistris, and I will play the
man so properly, that, trust me, in what company so
ever I come, I will not bee discovered. I will buy mee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a suite, and have my rapier very handsomely at my
side, and if any knave offer wrong, your page will
shew him the point of his weapon. At this Alinda
smiled, and upon this they agreed, and presentlie
gathered up all their jewels which they trussed up in a
casket.... They travailed along the vineyards, and
by many by-waies, at last got to the forrest side," the
forest of Arden, which at that time happened to be near
the vineyards of Gascony.</p>

<p>But this geographical situation is the least of the
wonders offered by the forest. In it live not only Gerismond,
the lawful king, very happy and contented, free
and without care, wanting nothing; but, in the valleys,
the most lovable shepherdesses and the most loving
shepherds; they feed their flocks while piping their
ditties; they inscribe their sonnets on the bark of trees;
they are very learned, though mere shepherds; they
quote Latin and write French; they know how to ask
the god of love that the heart of their mistress may
not be "de glace."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bien qu'elle ait de neige le sein."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They live in the shade of the most unaccountable
woods, woods composed of pine-trees, fig-trees, and
lemon-trees. "Then, comming into a faire valley, compassed
with mountaines whereon grewe many pleasant
shrubbs, they might descrie where two flocks of sheepe
did feede. Then looking about they might perceive
where an old shepheard sat, and with him a yong swaine,
under a covert most pleasantlie scituated. The ground
where they sat was diapred with Floras riches, as if she
ment to wrap Tellus in the glorie of her vestments:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
round about, in the forme of an amphitheater were
most curiouslie planted pine-trees, interseamed with
limons and citrons, which with the thicknesse of their
boughes so shadowed the place, that Ph&#339;bus could not
prie into the secret of that arbour.... Fast by ...
was there a fount so christalline and cleere that it seemed
Diana and her Driades and Hemadriades had that
spring as the secret of all their bathings. In this
glorious arbour sat these two shepheards seeing their
sheepe feede, playing on their pipes...." It is like
a landscape by Poussin. Alinda and her page find
the place very pleasant, and decide to settle there,
especially when they have heard what a shepherd's
life is like. "For a shepheards life, oh! mistresse,
did you but live a while in their content, you
would saye the court were rather a place of sorrowe
than of solace ... Envie stirres not us, wee covet not
to climbe, our desires mount not above our degrees,
nor our thoughts above our fortunes. Care cannot
harbour in our cottages, nor doo our homely couches
know broken slumbers." Fine assertions, to which some
hundred and fifty years later Prince Rasselas was most
solemnly to give the lie. But his time had not yet come,
and both princesses resolve to settle there, to purchase
flocks, and "live quiet, unknowen, and contented."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Many other pleasant things are to be found in the
forest; in fact, the two ladies meet their lovers there;
brave Rosader, the Gamelyn of Chaucerian times, the
Orlando of Shakespeare, and wicked but repentant and
reformed Saladin, who loves Alinda as Rosader loves
Rosalind. They meet, too, the shepherdess Ph&#339;be, "as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
faire as the wanton that brought Troy to ruine," but
in a different dress; "she in a peticoate of scarlet,
covered with a greene mantle, and to shrowde her from
the sunne, a chaplet of roses;" in a different mood, too,
towards shepherds, thinking nothing of her Paris, poor
Montanus whom she disdains while he is dying for
her.</p>

<p>Yet there were even more wonders in this forest of
Arcadian shepherds, exiled princesses, and lemon-trees.
There were "certaine rascalls that lived by prowling in
the forrest, who for feare of the provost marshall had
caves in the groves and thickets";<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> there were lions,
too, very dangerous, hungry, man-eating lions. Such
animals appear in Shakespeare also, as well as "palm
trees," and Shakespeare moreover takes the liberty of
doubling his lion with a serpent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Let us not be too much troubled; here will be good
opportunities for lovers to show the sort of men they
are, to be wounded, but not disfigured, and finally to
be loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>So many rare encounters of men and animals, and
shepherds and lovers, give excellent occasions for
Rosalind to display the special turn of her mind, and
if, in Lodge, she has not all the ready wit that
Shakespeare has given her, she is by no means slow of
speech; she possesses besides much more of that human
kindness in which we sometimes find the brilliant page
of the play a little deficient. The conversations between
her and Alinda are very pleasant to read, and show how
at last, not only on the stage, but even in novels, the
tongues of the speakers had been loosened.</p>

<p>"No doubt, quoth Aliena,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> this poesie is the
passion of some perplexed shepheard, that being
enamoured of some fair and beautifull shepheardesse
suffered some sharpe repulse, and therefore complained
of the cruelty of his mistris.</p>

<p>"You may see, quoth Ganimede [Rosalind's page-name],
what mad cattell you women be, whose hearts
sometimes are made of adamant that will touch with
no impression, and sometimes of waxe that is fit for
everie forme; they delight to be courted and then they
glorie to seeme coy, and when they are most desired,
then they freeze with disdaine....</p>

<p>"And I pray you, quoth Aliena, if your roabes
were off, what mettall are you made of that you are
so satyricall against women?... Beware, Ganimede,
that Rosader heare you not....</p>

<p>"Thus, quoth Ganimede, I keepe decorum, I
speake now as I am Alienas page, not as I am
Gerismonds daughter; for put me but into a peticoate,
and I will stand in defiance to the uttermost, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
women are courteous, constant, virtuous, and what
not."</p>

<p>Thus there is much merry prattle between these two,
especially when the presence of the lover of the one
sharpens the teasing disposition of the other; when,
for example, Rosader finding, not without good cause,
some resemblance between the page and his Rosalind,
pities the former, for not equalling the perfection of
his mistress.</p>

<p>"He hath answered you, Ganimede, quoth Aliena,
it is inough for pages to waite on beautifull ladies and
not to be beautifull themselves.</p>

<p>"Oh! mistres," answers the she-page, who cannot
help feeling some spite, "holde your peace, for you
are partiall; who knowes not, but that all women
have desire to tie sovereigntie to their peticoats, and
ascribe beautie to themselves, where if boyes might
put on their garments, perhaps they would proove as
comely; if not as comely, it may be more curteous."</p>

<p>There are also some morning scenes full of pleasant
mirth and cheerful light, in which perhaps there
is more of Ph&#339;bus than of the sun, and more of
Aurora than of the dawn; but this light, such as it
is, is worth the looking at, so merrily it shines; and
the talk of these early risers well suits the half-classic
landscape.</p>

<p>"The sunne was no sooner stept from the bed of
Aurora, but Aliena was wakened by Ganimede, who
restlesse all night, had tossed in her passions; saying
it was then time to goe to the field to unfold their
sheepe.</p>

<p>"Aliena ... replied thus: What? wanton, the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
is but new up, and as yet Iris riches lies folded in the
bosom of Flora; Ph&#339;bus hath not dried the pearled
deaw, and so long Coridon hath taught me it is not
fit to lead the sheepe abroad lest the deaw being
unwholesome they get the rot. But now see I the
old proverbe true ..." (and here comes some
euphuism).</p>

<p>"Come on," answers Ganimede, who does not seem
in a mood to appreciate euphuism just then, "this
sermon of yours is but a subtiltie to lie still a bed,
because either you think the morning colde, or els I
being gone, you would steale a nappe; this shifte
carries no palme, and therefore up and away. And
for Love, let me alone; Ile whip him away with
nettles and set Disdaine as a charme to withstand his
forces; and therefore, looke you to your selfe; be not
too bolde, for Venus can make you bend; nor too coy,
for Cupid hath a piercing dart that will make you cry
<i>Peccavi</i>.</p>

<p>"And that is it, quoth Aliena, that hath raysed
you so early this morning?</p>

<p>"And with that she slipt on her peticoate, and
start up; and assoone as she had made her readie
and taken her breakfast, away goe these two with
their bagge and bottles to the field, in more pleasant
content of mind than ever they were in the court of
Torismond."</p>

<p>In the same way as in Shakespeare, fair Ph&#339;be,
deceived by Rosalind's dress, Ph&#339;be, who thought
herself beyond the reach of love, becomes enamoured
of the page and feels at last all the pangs of an
unrequited passion. Lodge's Rosalind, more human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
we think than her great Shakespearean sister, uses, to
persuade Ph&#339;be into loving Montanus, a kindly, tender
language, meant to heal rather than irritate the poor
shepherdess's wounds. "What!" will exclaim the
great sister, ...</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... What though you have no beauty ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see no more in you than in the ordinary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature's sale-work: Od's my little life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think she means to tangle my eyes too:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, 'faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk-hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can entame my spirits to your worship."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Very spiritless, and tame, and old fashioned, will
the other Rosalind appear by the side of this
impetuous, relentless deity. A few perhaps will
consider that her tame, kindly, old-fashioned, mythological
piece of advice to the shepherdess, makes her
the more lovable: "What, shepheardesse, so fayre and
so cruell?... Because thou art beautifull, be not so
coye: as there is nothing more faire, so there is nothing
more fading, as momentary as the shadowes which
growes from a cloudie sunne. Such, my faire
shepheardesse, as disdaine in youth, desire in age, and
then are they hated in the winter, that might have
been loved in the prime. A wrinkled maid is like
a parched rose, that is cast up in coffers to please
the smell, not worn in the hand to content the eye.
There is no folly in love to had-I-wist, and therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
be rulde by me. Love while thou art young, least
thou be disdained when thou art olde. Beautie nor
time cannot bee recalde, and if thou love, like of
Montanus; for if his desires are manie, so his deserts
are great."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And it is indeed quite touching to see
poor Montanus in the simplest lover fashion verify by
his acts this description of himself; for while reduced
to the last degree of despair, seeing the unconquerable
love Ph&#339;be entertains for the page, he beseeches
Rosalind to save her by returning her love; sorrow
will kill him any way, but he will die contented
if he thinks that even through another's love Ph&#339;be
will live happy in her Arcadian vale.</p>

<p>I need not add that all these troubles end as happily
as possible; the storms pass away and a many-coloured
rainbow encompasses Arden, Arcady, and the kingdom
of France; every lover becomes loved, the three
couples get married, and while the music of the bridal
f&ecirc;te is still in our ears, news is brought that "hard
by, at the edge of this forest, the twelve peers of
France are up in arms" to recover Gerismond's rights.
They accomplish this feat in a twinkling, as French
peers should; why they did not do it before does not
appear: probably because the treble marriage would
not have looked so pretty in Notre Dame as under the
lemon trees. There is much bloodshed of course, but
it is blood we do not care for, and we are allowed
to part from our shepherd friends with the pleasing
thought that they will see no end to their loves and
happiness.</p>

<p>Such is "Euphues golden legacy," one of the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
examples of the sort of novel that was being written
at this period. It has all the characteristics of this
kind of writing such as it had come to be
understood at that date; prose is mixed with verse,
and several of Lodge's best songs are included in
"Rosalynde"; it is full of meditations and monologues
like those with which the neo-classic drama of the
French school has made us familiar.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In the more
important places, in monologues, speeches and letters
euphuistic style usually prevails;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the chronology
and geography of the tale, its logic and probability,
the grouping of events are of the loosest description;
but it has moreover a freshness and sometimes a pathos
which is more easily felt than expressed and of which
the above quotations may have given some idea.</p>

<p>In "Rosalynde" we see Lodge at his best. Perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
remembering his threats, it is better not to try to see
him at his worst; it will therefore be sufficient to add
that, having published also satires and epistles imitated
from Horace, eclogues, some other short stories or
romances, a translation of the philosophical works of
Seneca, two or three incoherent dramas (in one of which
a whale comes on to the stage, and without any
ceremony vomits forth the prophet Jonah),<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Lodge
changed his profession once again, abandoned the
sword for the lancet, became a physician, gained a
fortune, and died quietly a rich citizen in 1625.</p>

<p>He had thus lived beyond the period of Lyly's
fame, of Greene's reputation, of Shakespeare's
splendour, and saw, before he died, the beginnings
of a new and very different era in which both the
drama and the novel were to undergo, as we shall
see, many and vast transformations.</p>

to the story of the shepherdess Felismena, in Montemayor's
"Diana." But Shakespeare may have taken some hints also from
Warner. Opheltes (Proteus) married (not betrothed) to the
virtuous Alcippe (Julia), goes to "Sardis," where he becomes
acquainted (in the same manner as Greene's Francesco) with the
courtesan Ph&#339;monoe (Greene's Infida). Alcippe hears of it, and
wants at least to be able to see her husband; she enters the service
of the courtesan, and there suffers a moral martyrdom. Opheltes
is ruined, and, in words which Greene nearly copied, "Ph&#339;monoe
not brooking the cumbersome haunt of so beggerly a guest,
with outragious tearms flatly forbad him her house." Alcippe
makes herself known, and all ends well for the couple.</p></div>

part of "Mamillia" (entered 1583) is dated "from my studie in
Clarehall." Later in life he seems to have again felt the want of
increasing his knowledge, and he was, for a while, incorporated
at Oxford, July, 1588; he, therefore, describes himself on the
title-page of some of his works, not without touch of pride, as
belonging to both universities. In common with his friend Lodge
he had a taste for medical studies, and he appears to have attempted
to open to himself a career of this kind; he styles himself on the
title-page of "Planetomachia," 1585, as "Student in Phisicke,"
but as he never gave himself any higher appellation we may take it
for granted that he never went beyond the preliminaries.</p></div>

some protest, and Henry Chettle, who had edited Greene's
"Groats-worth" after his death, felt obliged to print a rectification
in his next book, as was the custom then, when newspapers did
not exist. This acknowledgment, that would to-day have been published
in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> or the <i>Academy</i>, was inserted in his "Kind
Heart's Dream," issued in the same year, 1592, and is to the effect
that so far as Shakespeare (for Chettle can allude here to no other)
is concerned: "divers of worship have reported his uprightnes of
dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing
that approoves his art."</p></div>

is noteworthy as being an almost if not quite unique example of an
attempt in Elizabethan times to write a pseudo-historical novel in
the style of the period referred to. Greene set to work expressly
with such a purpose, and he states it in the title of the book and
in its preface: "Gentlemen, I have written of Tullies love, a
worke attempted to win your favours, but to discover mine owne
ignorance in that coveting to counterfeit Tullies phrase, I have lost
myself in unproper words." In this tale Cicero is represented
standing at the tribune and haranguing the senate: "Conscript
fathers and grave senators of Rome," &amp;c.</p></div>

of it is dedicated to Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, the
famous sister of Sir Philip: "The Countesse of Pembrookes love,"
1592; "The Countesse of Pembroke's passion" (no date). His
pastoral poetry is among the best of his time. He left also
moral essays and characters or typical portraits: "Characters upon
essaies morall and divine, 1615," dedicated to Bacon, and concerning
wisdom, learning, knowledge, patience, love, peace, war and
other, even then, rather trite subjects. "The good and badde,"
1616, contains characters of a knave, an usurer, a virgin, a parasite,
a goodman, an "atheist or most badde man: hee makes robberie
his purchase, lecherie his solace, mirth his exercise, and drunkennesse
his glory," &amp;c. These books of "Characters" were extremely
popular. <i>Cf.</i> "Characters of virtues and vices" by Hall, 1608;

was translated into French by J. Dymocke, "Le vice
ridicule," Louvain, 1671, 12mo. One of his most curious works
is his "Fantasticks," 1626.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_155_155" id="Footnote_155_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_155_155"><span class="label">[155]</span></a> The principal novels or short stories of Lodge are: "Forbonius
and Prisceria," 1584, reprinted by the Shakespeare
Society, 1853; "Rosalynde, Euphues golden legacie found after
his death in his cell at Silexedra ... fetcht from the Canaries,"
1590, reprinted by Hazlitt, 1875, and again in a popular form by
Prof. H. Morley, 1887; "The famous, true, and historicall life
of ... Robin the divell," 1591; "Euphues shadow the battaile
of the sences wherein youthful folly is set downe," 1592;
it was edited by Greene in the absence of his friend, who was at
sea "upon a long voyage." The story takes place in Italy at the
time when "Octavius possessed the monarchy of the whole world."
"The Margarite of America," 1596, reprinted by Halliwell, 1859.
In this romance (p. 116), Lodge incidentally eulogizes his contemporary
the French poet Philippe Desportes, and he mentions
the popularity of his works in England. The "Complete Works" of
Lodge have been published by the Hunterian Club, ed. Gosse,
Glasgow, 1875, <i>et seq.</i></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>SIR PHILIP SIDNEY AND PASTORAL ROMANCE.</h3>


<p>When nowadays we see our shepherds, wrapped
in their long brown cloaks, silently following
the high roads in the midst of a suffocating
dust which seems to come out of their sheep, it is
difficult to explain the enthusiasm that has ascribed to
this race of mutes such fine speeches and such pleasant
adventures. Greeks, Romans, Italians, Spaniards, the
French and the English, have differed in a multitude
of points, but they have one and all delighted in
pastorals. No class of heroes either in history or
fiction has uttered so much verse and prose as the
keepers of sheep. Neither Ajax son of Telamon, nor
the wise king of Ithaca, nor Merlin, Lancelot, or
Charlemagne, nor even the inexhaustible Grandison,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
can bear the least comparison with Tityrus. It is
easy to give many reasons for this; but the phenomenon
still remains somewhat strange. The best
explanation is perhaps that the pastoral is one of the
most convenient pretexts existing for saying what would
otherwise be embarrassing. To many authors the
eclogue is like a canvas for trying their colours
and brushes. Many would not willingly confess
it, and Pope would have vowed a mortal hatred
to any one who explained his eclogues thus: but it
is better for his reputation to believe that he had at
least that reason for writing them. For some, the
pastoral is an allegory, where, if one would, place
can be given to Cynthia, Queen of the Sea, that is to
say, to Elizabeth, and to a Shepherd of the Ocean who
is Raleigh; it allows the poet to speak to kings,
to ask alms discreetly of them, and to thank them.</p>

<p>In England in Shakespeare's time people were passionately
fond of the country of Arcadia, not the
Arcady "for better for worse" that can be seen anywhere
outside London,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> but the old poetical Arcadia,
the Arcadia of nowhere, which was the more cherished
on account of its non-existence. They could invent at
their ease, imagine prodigious adventures and wonderful
amours; since no one had ever been in Arcadia, it
was hardly possible for any one to protest that events
happened differently there. To-day we think in quite
another way; we must be told of well-ascertained
facts, of warranted catastrophes, at once certified and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
provable. That is why the action of our novels, far
from carrying us into Arcadia, often unfolds itself in
our kitchens and on our back staircases. It is not at
all as it was in the time of Robert Greene.</p>

<p>Very rarely now does any one ask if perchance some
of these "Arcadias," so cherished by our fathers, contained
their share of enduring beauty, or if their
lasting success is to be explained otherwise than by
their improbabilities and their artificial embellishments.
Nevertheless the study might be profitable, for it must
be borne in mind that the readers of these romances
went in the afternoon to the "Globe" to see Shakespeare
play his own pieces, and that, admitting their fondness
for such dramas, in which, without speaking of other
merits, the kitchen is sometimes the place represented,
it would be surprising to find only mere nonsense in
the whole collection of their favoured romances. Let
these suggestions justify us at need in examining one
more Arcadia: besides, it is not that of a penniless
Bohemian; it is the Arcadia of Sir Philip Sidney, the
pattern of chivalrous perfection under Elizabeth. His
life is not, in its way, less characteristic of his time
than that of starving Robert Greene, or of Thomas
Lodge the corsair.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Born in 1554, in the noble castle of Penshurst in
Kent,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Sidney passed a part of his childhood in Ludlow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Castle, where in the next century Milton's "Comus"
was to be represented. At college he was famous for
his personal charm, his knowledge, and the thoughtful
turn of his mind. "I knew him," wrote in later years
his friend and companion Fulke Greville, "with such
staiednesse of mind, lovely and familiar gravity, as
carried grace and reverence above greater years."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
During the year 1572 he was staying in France,
where he had been appointed by King Charles IX.
one of the gentlemen of his chamber. It was the time
of the St. Bartholomew massacre, and Sidney, who
belonged to the English mission, remained in the house
of Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's ambassador,
and escaped the perils of that terrible day.</p>

<p>He left France shortly after and travelled in several
countries of Europe, studying men and nations, storing
his mind with information; he was comparatively free
from prejudice, and believed that useful examples and
precepts might be obtained even from "the great
Turk." "As surely," did he write some years later
to his brother Robert, "in the great Turk, though
we have nothing to do with him, yet his discipline
in war matters is ... worthy to be known and
learned. Nay even the kingdom of China which is
almost as far as the Antipodes from us, their good
laws and customs are to be learned."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
disposition of mind he visited successively Germany,
Austria, Hungary, and Italy. The most interesting
incident of his journey was the acquaintance he made
with a Frenchman, the political thinker Hubert
Languet, from whom Milton, a long time before
Rousseau, probably derived his ideas of the social
contract "f&#339;dus," says Languet, "inter [principem] and
populum," and his theories on the right of insurrection.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
A most tender friendship was formed between
the revolutionary writer and the aristocratic Sidney.
They began a correspondence which did not cease till
the former's death in 1581. Languet had great influence
over his young friend, and was constantly
giving him most manly advice and that best suited
to strengthen his character, warning him especially in
very wise fashion against a melancholy unsuitable to
his age, which in the grave Huguenot's opinion was
only a useless impedimentum in life. "I readily allow,"
wrote Sidney, in answer to his friend's remonstrances,
"that I am often more serious than either my age or
my pursuits demand."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> That this tendency to pensiveness
left its trace on his features may be seen in
most of his portraits, among others in that by Isaac
Oliver, of which we give a reproduction.</p>

<p>The most interesting of Sidney's portraits is unfortunately
lost. He sat for it while in Italy, at the request
of his friend, and chose no mean artist to paint it:
"As soon as ever I return to Venice, I will have it
done, either by Paul Veronese or by Tintoretto, who
hold by far the highest place in the art." He decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
for Veronese, and sent the picture to Languet, who
wrote shortly after: "As long as I enjoyed the sight
of you, I made no great account of the portrait you
gave me, and scarcely thanked you for so beautiful
a present. I was led by regret for you on my return
from Frankfort to place it in a frame and fix it in a
conspicuous place. When I had done this, it appeared
to me so beautiful and so strongly to resemble you
that I possess nothing that I value more ... The
painter has represented you sad and thoughtful. I
should have been better pleased if your face had worn
a more cheerful look when you sat for the painting."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
When Languet died, Sidney described his sentiments
for him in a touching poem, inserted in his "Arcadia";
it was sung by the shepherd Philisides, who represents
the author himself and whose name is a contraction
of the words Philip Sidney:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I sate me downe; for see to goe ne could,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang unto my sheepe lest stray they should.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song I sang old Lan[g]uet had me taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lan[g]uet, the shepeard best swift Ister knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For clearkly reed, and hating what is naught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For faithfull heart, cleane hands and mouth as true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his sweet skill my skillesse youth he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have a feeling taste of him that sits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the heaven, farre more beyond our wits ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With old true tales he wont mine cares to fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shepeards did of yore, how now they thrive ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He liked me, but pitied lustfull youth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His good strong staffe my slipperie yeares upbore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He still hop'd well because I loved truth."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>In 1575, when twenty-one years old, Sidney returned
to shine at court, where his uncle Leicester, the Queen's
favourite was to make all things easy for him. He
assisted that year at the f&ecirc;tes given in Elizabeth's
honour at Kenilworth, in those famous gardens "though
not so goodly," writes a witness of the festivities, "as
Paradis, for want of the fayr rivers, yet better a great
deal by the lack of so unhappy a tree."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Then Sidney
accompanied the Queen to Chartley, and these ceremonies
mark a great epoch in his existence. While
Elizabeth listened to the compliments of her entertainers,
Sidney's eyes were fixed on a child. A
sentiment, the full strength of which he was to feel
only in after time, sprang up in his heart for Penelope
Devereux, the twelve-year-old daughter of the Earl
of Essex, who was as beautiful as Dante's Beatrice.
He began to visit at her father's house frequently; it
seemed as if a marriage would ensue; Essex himself
was favourable to it, but for some cause or other Sidney
did not press his suit; and while his friend Languet
strongly advised him to marry, he was answering him
in the leisurely style of one who believes himself
heart-whole: "Respecting her of whom I readily
acknowledge how unworthy I am, I have written you
my reasons long since, briefly indeed, but yet as well
as I was able."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He was soon to write in a very
different manner. Penelope, the Stella of Sidney's
verse, was, very much against her will, compelled at
last by her family to marry the wealthy Lord Rich,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and then Sidney awoke to his fate: what he had
believed to be mere inclination, a light feeling of which
he would always remain the master, had from the first
been Love, irrepressible, unconquerable love:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I might;&mdash;unhappie word&mdash;O me, I might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then would not, or could not see my blisse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till now wrapt in a most infernall night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He remained a lover of Stella, saw her, wrote to
her, sang of her, and at length ascertained that she
too, despite her marriage ties, loved him. He continued
then, in altered tones, the magnificent series of sonnets
dedicated to her and which read still like a love-drama
of real life, a love-drama which is all summarized in
the beautiful and well-known dirge:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ring out your belles, let mourning shewes be spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Love is dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All Love is dead, infected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With plague of deep disdaine:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Worth, as nought worth, rejected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Faith faire scorne doth game.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From so ungratefull fancie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From such a femall franzie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From them that use men thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good Lord, deliver us!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weepe, neighbours, weepe; do you not heare it said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Love is dead?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! I lie: rage hath this errour bred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love is not dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Love is not dead, but sleepeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her unmatch&egrave;d mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where she his counsell keepeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till due desert she find.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore from so vile fancie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To call such wit a franzie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who Love can temper thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good Lord, deliver us!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Love that was not dead but asleep awoke, and Sidney's
raptures were again expressed in his verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O joy too high for my low stile to show!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Stella hath, with words where faith doth shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her high heart giv'n me the monarchie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, I, O I, may say that she is mine."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This lasted some time and when love faded away,
at least in Stella's fickle heart, "Astrophel" wrote the
real dirge of his passion.</p>

<p>Sidney had nevertheless continued his active life all
this while, sometimes at court and sometimes on the
continent, recognized as a statesman by statesmen, as a
poet by poets, as a perfect knight by all experts in
knightly accomplishments. Spenser dedicated in 1579
his "Shepheardes Calender" to "the most noble and
vertuous gentleman, most worthy of all titles, both of
learning and chevalrie, M. Philip Sidney"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
William the Silent, Prince of Orange, once said to
Fulke Greville that "Her Majesty had one of the ripest
and greatest counsellors of estate in Sir Philip Sidney
that at this day lived in Europe." The remaining
years of his short life were well filled; he had been
ambassador to the German Emperor in 1577; he had
taken part at home, though unasked, in the negotiations
concerning the Queen's marriage, and he lost favour
for a while on account of the extraordinary freedom
with which he had written to Elizabeth against the
French match. He retired from court at that moment
and went to live in the country; while staying with
his sister at Wilton in the midst of congenial surroundings,
he wrote most of his "Arcadia" (1580).
He was a member of Parliament in 1581 and 1584,
and married in 1583 the daughter of Sir Francis
Walsingham. He all but accompanied Drake to
America, where he had received from the Queen a large
grant of lands; he became at last Governor of Flushing
in the Netherlands. He died in that country at thirty-one
years of age, in 1586, of a wound received at
Zutphen; a premature death that gave the finishing
touch to men's sympathy and love for him; all
England wept for him.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Even now, it is difficult to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
think unmoved of his well-filled career ending on
the eve of the great triumphs of his country, to call
to our memory this brave man who died with his face
to the enemy without knowing that victory would be
declared for his side, without having known Shakespeare,
without having seen the defeat of the Armada.</p>

<p>As for his Stella she survived him only too long. A
few years after Sidney's death she deserted her husband
by whom she had had seven children, and became the
mistress of Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, afterwards
Earl of Devonshire, to whom she gave three sons and
two daughters. Lord Rich, a man full of prudence it
seems, waited for the death of the Earl of Essex, his
wife's brother, to divorce her. She then married her
lover in 1605. But till her death, which happened in
1608 she was mostly remembered as having been
Sidney's friend, and books were dedicated to her because
she had been Astrophel's "Stella." Thus Yong's
translation of the "Diana" of Montemayor, a pastoral
from which Sidney had taken many hints, is dedicated
to her.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Thus again Florio asks her conjointly with
Sidney's daughter<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> to patronize the second book of
Montaigne's Essays, addressing Penelope, in the extraordinary
style that belonged to him: "I meane you
(truely richest Ladie Rich) in riches of fortune not
deficient, but of body incomparably richer, of minde
most rich: who yet, like Cornelia, were you out-vied,
or by rich shewes envited to shew your richest jewelles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
would stay till your sweet images (your deere-sweete
children) came from schoole." And then, addressing
the ladies together, both the daughter and the mistress
of the departed hero: "I know not this nor any I
have seen, or can conceive, in this or other language,
can in aught be compared to that perfect-imperfect
Arcadia, which all our world yet weepes with you, that
your all praise-exceeding father (his praise-succeeding
countesse) your worthy friend (praise-worthiest lady)

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Sidney's works well accord with his life; in these few
years he had time to take in with a clear and kindly
glance all those beauties of ancient or modern times,
of distant countries or of his own which set the hearts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of his contemporaries beating, and he is therefore
perhaps, on account of his catholicity, the most worthy
of Shakespeare's immediate precursors. The brilliance
of the Spaniards enchants him, and he translates
fragments of Montemayor<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>; the Kenilworth f&ecirc;tes
amuse him and he writes a masque, "The Lady of
May,"<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> to be used at like festivities. A true Christian
he translates the Psalms of David; a tender and
passionate heart, he rhymes the sonnets of Astrophel to
Stella; enamoured of chivalry and great exploits, he
writes, with fluent pen, his "Arcadia," where he
imitates the style made fashionable in Europe by Montemayor
in his "Diana"; a lover of <i>belles lettres</i>, he
defends the poet's art in an argument charming from
its youthfulness, vibrating with enthusiasm, which
holds in English literature the place filled in French by
F&eacute;nelon's "Lettre &agrave; l'Acad&eacute;mie."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This work is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
important with regard to the subject that now occupies
us, not only because Sidney gives in it his opinion on
works of fiction in general; but because here we have
at last a specimen of flexible, spirited, fluent prose,
without excessive ornament of style, or learned <i>impedimenta</i>,
a specimen of that prose which is exactly suited
to novels and that no one&mdash;Roger Ascham perhaps
excepted&mdash;had until then used in England.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be found, he writes at the beginning
of his work, with the elegant gracefulness of a
man who knows how to do everything that he does
well, that I carry my apology to excess; but that is
excusable: listen to what Pietro Pugliano, my master
of horsemanship, at the Emperor's Court, said: "Hee
sayde souldiours were the noblest estate of mankinde,
and horsemen, the noblest of souldiours. Hee sayde,
they were the maisters of warre, and ornaments of
peace: speedy goers and strong abiders, triumphers
both in camp and courts." For a prince no accomplishment
is comparable to that of being a good
horseman; "skill of government was but a Pedanteria
in comparison: then would hee adde certaine prayses,
by telling what a peerlesse beast a horse was. The
onely serviceable courtier without flattery, the beast of
most beutie, faithfulnes, courage, and such more, that
if I had not beene a peece of a logician before I came to
him, I think he would have perswaded mee to have
wished my selfe a horse. But thus much at least with
his no fewe words hee drave into me, that selfe-love is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
better then any guilding to make that seeme gorgious,
wherein our selves are parties. Wherein, if Pugliano
his strong affection and weake arguments will not
satisfie you, I wil give you a neerer example of my
selfe, who (I knowe not by what mischance) in these my
not old yeres and idelest times, having slipt into the
title of a poet, am provoked to say somthing unto
you in the defence of that my unelected vocation."</p>

<p>Set at ease by Pugliano's example, who seems to have
had the same veneration for the horse as his countryman
Vinci, Sidney enters on his defence and does not
restrain himself from extolling poetry beyond any
product of the human mind. Poetry is superior to
history, to philosophy, to all forms of literature. Poets
have, by the charm of their works, surpassed the
beauties of nature and they have succeeded in making
"the too much loved earth more lovely." He gives to
poetry, in effect, an immense domain: everything that
is poetic or even merely a work of the imagination is
poetry for him: "there have beene many most excellent
poets, that never versified, and now swarme many
versifiers that neede never aunswere to the name of
poets." For him, the romance of "Theagines and
Cariclea" is a "poem"; Xenophon's "Cyrus" is "an
absolute heroicall poem." To the great joy of their
author he would certainly have seen an epic in Chateaubriand's
"Martyrs." "It is not riming and versing
that maketh a poet, no more then a long gowne maketh
an advocate: who though he pleaded in armor should
be an advocate and no soldiour." Even historians
have sometimes to do the work of poets, that is
imagining, inventing, "although theyr lippes sounde of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
things doone and veritie be written in theyr foreheads."</p>

<p>In spite of his fondness for the ancients, whose
unities and messenger he greatly approves, and of his
contempt for the modern drama, such as it was
understood in those pre-Shakespearean times, he remains,
at bottom, entirely English; he adores the old
memorials of his native land, and does not know his
Virgil better than his Chaucer, or even the popular
songs hummed by the wayfarer along the high roads.
Irish ballads, English ballads of Robin Hood, Scottish
ballads of Douglas, are familiar to him, and some of
them make him start as at the sound of a trumpet:
"Certainly, I must confesse my own barbarousnes, I
never heard the olde song of Percy and Douglas, that
I found not my heart mooved more then with a
trumpet: and yet it is sung by some blind crouder,
with no rougher voyce then rude stile; which being
so evill apparelled in the dust and cobwebbes of that
uncivill age, what would it worke, trymmed in the
gorgeous eloquence of Pindar?" He would have
loved, like Moli&egrave;re, the song of the "roi Henri," and
like La Fontaine, the story of Peau d'Ane. But his
closest sympathies were reserved for poetical tales, for
the adventures of Roland and King Arthur, which are
a soldier's reading, and even for the exploits of
Amadis of Gaul. "I dare undertake 'Orlando furioso'
or honest King Arthur will never displease a souldier....
Truely, I have knowen men, that even with
reading 'Amadis de Gaule,' which God knoweth
wanteth much of a perfect poesie, have found their
hearts mooved to the exercise of courtesie, liberalitie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and especially courage." He imagines nothing more
enchanting or more powerful than the charm of
poetical prose stories, "any of which holdeth children
from play, and old men from the chimney corner."
Their attraction has something superior, divine; for,
he adds with a depth of emotion that appears quite
modern, "so is it in men, most of which are childish
in the best things, till they bee cradlid in their
graves."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>He closes with a witty and delightful ending, a
kindly wish for the hardened enemies of poetry:
"Yet this much curse I must send you, in the behalfe
of all Poets, that while you live, you live in love, and
never get favour, for lacking skill of a sonnet: and
when you die, your memory die from the earth, for
want of an epitaph."</p>

<p>Neither did Sidney lack epitaphs; all the poets wept
for him; nor was he wanting in those favours that a
sonnet can win, for he wrote the most passionate that
appeared in England before those of Shakespeare.
Like the "Apologie" they move us by their youth
and sincerity; they come from the heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Loving in truth, and faine in verse my love to show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That She, dear She! might take some pleasure of my paine:<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, when Sidney took up his pen to
write his "Arcadia,"<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> he no longer looked into his
heart; he loosed the rein of his imagination, and,
without concerning himself with a critical posterity
for whom the book was not destined, he only wished,
like Lyly, to write a romance for ladies, or rather for
one lady, his sister, the Countess of Pembroke, famous as
his sister, famous as a patron of letters,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> famous also as
the mother of William Herbert, the future friend of
Shakespeare, the "W. H." for whom in all probability
the sonnets of the great poet were written. Sidney
sent the sheets to his sister as fast as he penned them,
charging her to destroy them, a thing she did not do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
The poet knight only saw in it an amusement for
himself and for the Countess, and he gave free vent
to his fondness for poetical prose: "For severer eyes
it is not," says he to his sister, "being but a trifle and
that triflingly handled. Your deare selfe can best
witnesse the manner, being done in loose sheets of
paper, most of it in your presence, the rest by sheetes,
sent unto you as fast as they were done. In summe, a
young head, not so well staied as I would it were (and
shall bee when God will) having many fancies begotten
in it, if it had not beene in some way delivered, would
have growne a monster, and more sorry might I bee
that they came in than that they gat out." His
"Apologie" was perhaps from its style more useful
to the development of the novel than the "Arcadia";
but the latter, in spite of its enormous defects of style
and composition, was also of use, and it is not unimportant
to note that its influence lasted until and even
beyond the time of Richardson.</p>

<p>Sidney's romance is not, as might be believed, an
enormous pseudo-Greek pastoral, with tunic-wearing
shepherds in the foreground, piping their ditties to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
their flocks, to their nymphs, to Echo. Elizabethan
Arcadias were knightly Arcadias. Sidney's heroes are
all princes or the daughters of kings. Their adventures
take place in Greece, undoubtedly, and among
learned shepherds, but the great parts are left to the
noblemen, and the distance between the two classes is
well marked. However intelligent and well bred the
shepherds may be, they are only there for decoration
and ornament, to amuse the princes with their songs,
and to pull them out of the water when they are
drowning. There are Amadises and Palmerins in
Sidney's work. Amadis has come to live among the
shepherds, but he remains Amadis, as valiant and as
ready as ever to draw his sword. To please his sister
the better, Sidney mingles thus the two kinds of
affectations in fashion, the affectation of pastoral and
of chivalry, taking in this as his example the famous
"Diana" of George de Montemayor, which was then
the talk not only of Spain, but of all the reading public
in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> As for the shepherds, are we to pity them
because their domain is invaded by foreign knights, by
whom they are dispossessed of the high rank belonging
to them, of all places, in Arcady? There is no need
for pity; a time will come when they will repay their
invaders, and the end of their piping has not come yet.
Leaving their country, where their place has been taken
by British noblemen, we shall see them some day
invade the land of their conquerors, and, sitting in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
their turn under the elms of Windsor Park, sing their
songs at the call of Mr. Pope. They will look a little
awry, no doubt, among the mists of an English
landscape, with their loose tunics, bare limbs, and
"in-folio" wigs; but they will prove none the less
fine speakers, and they will for a time concentrate
upon themselves the attention of the capital. Better
still will be their treatment at the hands of a
Frenchman, not a poet, but a painter, Gaspard Poussin,
who will gain more permanent attention and sympathy
for them than most poets when he will inscribe in his
canvas, on the representation of a ruined tomb, his
famous "Et in Arcadia ego."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Sidney's heroes, in the meantime, Prince Musidorus
and Prince Pyrocles, the latter disguised as a woman
under the name of the amazon Zelmane, are in love
with the Princesses Pamela and Philoclea, daughters of
the King of Arcady. A great many crosses are in the
way of the lovers' happiness. They have to fight
helots, lions, bears, enemies from Corinth. They lose
each other, find each other again, and relate their
adventures. The masculine amazon especially does
wonders, for she has to fight not only with the sword,
but in argument. She is so pretty in woman's costume
that the old king Basilius, until then wise and virtuous,
falls distractedly in love with her, as imprudent as
Fior-di-Spina in Ariosto; while the queen, whom the
disguise does not deceive, feels an intense passion spring
up in her heart for the false amazon and a terrible
jealousy of her own daughter, Philoclea.</p>

<p>Disguises are numerous in this romance; they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
also frequent in Shakespeare's plays and in most of
the novels of the time. Parthenia gives herself out
to her admirer, Argalus, as the Queen of Corinth,
whom she resembles, and announces her own death.
As pretended queen she offers her hand to Argalus,
to prove him; but he refuses with horror; she then
discovers herself to this paragon of lovers, and gives
him his Parthenia alive and more loving than ever.</p>

<p>When we read now of such disguises, of princes
Pyrocles dressed as women, of Rosalinds dressed as
pages, we are tempted to smile at the vain fancies of
the novelists of the Shakespearean era.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> But it must
not be forgotten that, after all, there was not so much
invention in these fancies, and that living examples were
not rare from which writers might copy. Disguises were
abundantly used in f&ecirc;tes and ceremonies, but they were
also utilized in actual life. The manners of the time
in this particular are well illustrated by the earnest
entreaties of a certain ambassador to Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth, advising her to leave her palace
secretly and travel over the country as his page. The
Queen was in no way shocked, but rather pleased;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
she did not order the ambassador to be turned out of
her palace, but heard him expound his plan, wishing
she might have followed it. This happened in one of
those curious conversations of which Melville, the
ambassador of Mary Queen of Scots, has left us an
account. Elizabeth was very desirous of seeing her
"dear sister" of Scotland and of judging with her own
eyes what truth there was in the reports concerning her
beauty. "Then again," says Melville, "she wished
that she might see the queen at some convenient place
of meeting. I offered to convey her secretly to Scotland
by post, clothed like a page, that under this
disguise she might see the queen, as James the fifth
had gone in disguise to France with his own Ambassadour,
to see the Duke of Vendom's sister,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> who
should have been his wife. Telling her that her
chamber might be kept in her absence, as though
she were sick; that none needed to be privy thereto
except my Lady Strafford and one of the grooms of
her chamber.</p>

<p>"She appeared to like that kind of language, only
answered it with a sigh, saying: Alas, if I might do it
thus."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Surely ladies who "appeared to like that kind of
language," and men who were wont to use it, would
be certain to accept with much pleasure representations
in plays and novels of he-Rosalinds and she-Pyrocles.</p>

<p>In the midst of battles, masques and eclogues,
interludes are consecrated to f&ecirc;tes of chivalry. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
much as in Italy, France or England, the knights of
Arcady challenge each other, and in brilliant tournaments
break lances in honour of their mistresses.
Sidney himself was very skilful at these sports; he
proved it about this time in the festivities of May, 1581,
by attacking with his companions, the Castle of perfect
Beauty, which was reputed to contain the grace and
attractions of the Queen, a treasure as may well be
believed, most allegorical. His sonnets more than
once refer to his prowess in the lists:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Having this day, my horse, my hand, my lance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both by the judgment of the English eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of some sent from that sweet enemie France.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towne-folks my strength; a daintier judge applies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His praise to sleight, which from good use doth rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some luckie wits impute it but a chance ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stella lookt on...."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his letters to his brother Robert, he is most
particular as to the every-day exercise by which the
young man should improve his fencing. He could
not help giving his tastes to his Arcadian knights.
They would, otherwise, have been considered by his
lady-readers, uninteresting barbarians. He therefore
allowed them good spurs and a ready lance; this
meant civilization. On a certain day every knight
appears in the vale of Arcady, with drawn sword, and
carrying a portrait of his fair lady; the painting is
to become the prey of the conqueror. The order of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
merit of the various beauties is thus determined by
blows of the lance. Pyrocles, who, dressed as a
woman, cannot take part in the fighting, has the
mortification of seeing the champion of Philoclea bite
the dust and give up her portrait. He goes immediately
and secretly puts on some wretched armour,
lowers his visor, and like a brave hero of romance,
runs into the lists, throws every one to the ground,
regains the portrait, and all the others as well. He
is proclaimed conqueror of the tourney, and the first
of knights, while at the same time, Philoclea becomes
again the most beautiful of women.</p>

<p>In this Arcadia of chivalry it must not be thought
that only cottages and huts are to be found; sometimes
the heroes sleep soundly in the open air, but
seldom. In this country there are palaces like those
of the rich English lords. The dwelling of the noble
Kalander is of this number. The park is magnificent,
and quite in the style of the Elizabethans, that style
which is so minutely described in Bacon's "Essay on
gardens." It did not differ much from the park at
Kenilworth, a place well known to Sidney: "whearin,
hard all along the castell wall iz reared a pleazaunt
terres of a ten foot hy and a twelve brode, even under
foot, and fresh of fyne grass: as iz allso the side thearof
toward the gardein, in whiche by sundry equall distauncez,
with obelisks, sphearz and white bearz [bears],
all of stone, upon theyr curiouz basez, by goodly shew
wear set; too theez, too fine arbers redolent by sweete
trees and floourz, at ech end one, the garden plot
under that, with fayr alleyz green by grass." There
were fountains with marble Tritons, with Neptune on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
his throne, and "Thetis on her chariot drawn by her
Dollphins,"<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> with many other gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>Kalander's gardens in Arcady were of the same
sort; their adornments were
not very sober, and many
eccentricities are presented as
beauties; thus the fashion of the
day would have it; Versailles
in comparison is simplicity itself.
Kalander and his guest go round
the place, and "as soone as the
descending of the staires had
delivered them downe, they
came into a place cunningly set
with trees of the most taste-pleasing
fruits: but scarcely they
had taken that into consideration,
but that they were suddenly
stept into a delicate greene; of
each side of the greene a thicket,
and behind the thickets againe
new beds of flowers, which being
under the trees, the trees were to
them a pavilion, and they to the
trees a mosaicall floore....</p>

<p>"In the middest of all the
place was a faire pond, whose
shaking cristall was a perfect mirrour to all the
other beauties, so that it bare shew of two gardens,
one in deed, the other in shadowes. And in one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>

Venus of white marble, wherin the graver had used
such cunning that the natural blue veins of the marble
were framed in fit places to set forth the beautifull
veines of her body. At
her breast she had her
babe &AElig;neas, who seemed,
having begun to sucke, to
leave that, to look upon
her faire eyes, which
smiled at the babe's folly,
meane while the breast
running."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The effect produced
must undoubtedly
have been very pleasant,
but scarcely more "natural"
than the embellishments
recommended by
Bacon, who declares that
hedges and arbours ought
to be enlivened by the
songs of birds; and that
to make such enlivening
sure and permanent, the
birds should be secured in
cages. A good example
of a garden in Sidney's
time with beds of flowers,
arbours, pavilions, and covered galleries is to be seen
in his own portrait by Isaac Oliver, of which we give
a reproduction. It must be noticed that only the
lower part of the long gallery at the back is built;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the vault-shaped upper portion is painted green, being
supposed to be made of actual leaves and foliage.
Except for such books as Sidney's it could not be said
of those gardens that "they too were once in Arcady."</p>

<p>Costumes and furniture are of the same style, and
accord with such gardens much more than with
shepherd life. They are pure Renaissance, half Italian
and half English. Musidorus disguised as a shepherd,
dresses his hair in such a way as to look much more
like one of the Renaissance Roman Emperors at
Hampton Court than like a keeper of sheep: we see
him while receiving a lesson on the use of the "sheep-hooke,"
wearing "a garland of laurell mixt with cypres
leaves on his head."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The glowing descriptions of
the private apartments of the heroes suit modern
palaces better than Greek cottages; while representations
of ladies recumbent on their couches are obvious
reminiscences of Tintoretto or Titian, whose newly
painted works Sidney had admired in Italy. Here is
a description of the beautiful Philoclea, resting in her
bedroom; it shows unmistakable signs of Sidney's
acquaintance with the Italian painters: "She at that
time lay, as the heate of that country did well suffer,
upon the top of her bed, having her beauties eclipsed
with nothing, but with her faire smocke, wrought all
in flames of ash-colour silk and gold; lying so upon
her right side, that the left thigh down to the foot,
yielded hir delightfull proportion to the full view, which
was seene by the helpe of a rich lampe, which thorow
the curtaines a little drawne cast forth a light upon her,
as the moone doth when it shines into a thinne wood."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p><p>Sidney, according to his friend Fulke Greville, Lord
Brooke, had the highest moral and political purposes,
in writing his "Arcadia": "In all these creatures of
his making, his interest and scope was, to turn the
barren philosophy precepts into pregnant images of
life; and in them, first on the monarchs part, lively
to represent the growth, state and declination of
princes, changes of government and lawes ... Then
again in the subjects case, the state of favour, disfavour,
prosperitie, adversity ... and all other moodes
of private fortunes or misfortunes, in which traverses,
I know, his purpose was to limn out such exact
pictures of every posture in the minde, that any man
might see how to set a good countenance upon all
the discountenances of adversitie."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> When Greville
wrote thus, Sidney was dead, and in his retrospect of
his friend's life he was with perfect good faith discovering
high, not to say holy motives, for all his
actions. Sidney's own explanation suits his work
better; he was delivering his "young head" of
"many, many fancies," and their main object was
not politics, but love. He described it as it was
known and practised in his time. Most of the
heroes in the "Arcadia," talk like Surrey, Wyatt,
Watson, and all the "amourists" of the century, like
Sidney himself when he addressed another than Stella.
The modesty of their characters is equal to their
tenderness; valiant as lions before the enemy, they
tremble like the leaf before their mistresses; they
feed on smiles and tender glances; when they have to
suffer a scarcity of this heavenly food they can only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
die: "Hee dieth: it is most true, hee dieth; and he
in whom you live dieth. Whereof if though hee
plaine, hee doth not complaine: for it is a harme
but no wrong which hee hath received. He dies,
because in wofull language all his senses tell him, that
such is your pleasure." Fair Pamela feels deeply
moved when reading this, and confesses her harshness;
she denied him a look: "Two times I must confess,"
says she to her sister, not without a pretty touch of
humour of a very modern sort, "I was about to take
curtesie into mine eyes, but both times the former
resolution stopt the entrie of it: so, that hee departed
without obtaining any further kindenesse. But he was
no sooner out of the doore, but that I looked to the
doore kindly!" The poor lover who did not see
this change in his lady's countenance went away
fainting, "as if he had beene but the coffin that carried
himselfe to his sepulchre!"<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Happiness produces the same effect on these heroes.
Pyrocles-Zelmane when present in his false quality of
woman at the bath of his mistress in the Ladon is
on the point of swooning with admiration.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> His friend,
Prince Musidorus, in the ecstasies of his passion, falls
"downe prostrate," uttering this prayer to the awful
god who reigns paramount in Arcady: "O thou, celestiall
or infernall spirit of Love, or what other heavenly
or hellish title thou list to have (for effects of both
I find in my selfe), have compassion of me, and let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
thy glory be as great in pardoning of them that be
submitted to thee as in conquering them that were
rebellious."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>But Sidney painted also amours of another sort, and
one of the great attractions of his book is the variety
in the descriptions of this passion. Never had the
like been seen before in any English novel, and as for
France, it must be remembered, that d'Urf&eacute;'s "Astr&eacute;e,"
which has kept its place in literature for the very same
quality, for its inconstant Hylas and its faithful
Celadon, for its Astr&eacute;e and its Madonte, was yet to
be written. Sidney has, among several others, created
one character which, forgotten as it is now, would
be enough to give a permanent interest to this too
much neglected romance; it is the Queen Gynecia,
who is consumed by a guilty love, and who is the
worthy contemporary of the strongly passionate heroes
of Marlowe's plays. With her, and for the first time,
the dramatic power of English genius leaves the stage
and comes to light in the novel; it was destined to
pass into it entirely.</p>

<p>Gynecia does not allow herself to be blinded by any
subterfuge; love has taken possession of her; the
rules of the world, the laws of blood, the precepts of
virtue that she has observed all her life, are lost sight
of; she is conscious of nothing but that she loves,
and is ready, like Ph&aelig;dra of old, to trample everything
under foot, to forsake everything, the domestic hearth,
child, husband: and it is very interesting to see, about
the time of Shakespeare, this purely dramatic character
develop itself in a novel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"O vertue," she cries, in her torment, "where doest
thou hide thy selfe? What hideous thing is this which
doth eclipse thee? or is it true that thou wert never
but a vaine name, and no essentiall thing; which
hast thus left thy professed servant, when she had
most neede of thy lovely presence? O imperfect
proportion of reason, which can too much foresee,
and too little prevent: Alas, alas, said she, if there
were but one hope for all my paines, or but one
excuse for all my faultinesse! But wretch that I am,
my torment is beyond all succour, and my evill
deserving doth exceed my evill fortune. For nothing
else did my husband take this strange resolution to
live so solitarily: for nothing else have the winds
delivered this strange guest to my countrey: for
nothing else have the destinies reserved my life to this
time, but that onely I, most wretched I, should become
a plague to my selfe and a shame to woman-kind. Yet
if my desire, how unjust soever it be, might take
effect, though a thousand deaths followed it, and
every death were followed with a thousand shames,
yet should not my sepulchre receive me without some
contentment. But, alas, so sure I am, that Zelmane
is such as can answer my love; yet as sure I am,
that this disguising must needs come for some foretaken
conceit: and then, wretched Gynecia, where canst
thou find any small ground plot for hope to dwell
upon? No, no, it is Philoclea his heart is set upon,
it is my daughter I have borne to supplant me: but
if it be so, the life I have given thee, ungratefull
Philoclea, I will sooner with these hands bereave thee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of, than my birth shall glory she hath bereaved me of
my desires."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>We see with how little reason the "Arcadia" is
sometimes placed in the category of bedizened pastorals,
where the reader is reduced to regret the absence of a
"little wolf," and whether Gynecia, in spite of the
oblivion which has gathered over her, does not deserve
a place by the side of the passionate heroines of Marlowe
and Webster rather than in a gallery of Lancret-like
characters.</p>

<p>Sidney, thus possesses the merit, unique at that time
with prose writers, of varying his subjects by marking its
<i>nuances</i> and by describing in his romance different kinds
of love. Side by side with Gynecia's passion, he has
set himself to paint the love of an old man in Basilius,
of a young man in Pyrocles, of a young girl in Pamela.
This last study led him to portray a scene which was
to be represented again by one of the great novelists
of the eighteenth century. Richardson borrowed from
Sidney, with the name of Pamela, the idea of the
adventure that shows her a prisoner of her enemies,
imploring heaven that her virtue may be preserved.
The wicked Cecropia who keeps Sidney's Pamela shut
up, laughs heartily at her invocations: "To thinke,"
she says, "that those powers, if there be any such,
above, are moved either by the eloquence of our
prayers, or in a chafe at the folly of our actions,
carries as much reason, as if flies should thinke that men
take great care which of them hums sweetest, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which of them flies nimblest." Pamela, "whose
cheeks were dyed in the beautifullest graine of vertuous
anger," replies by speeches which yield in nothing as
regards nobility and dignity, and length also, to those
of her future sister, and which are followed as in
Richardson, by an unexpected deliverance. These
speeches are famous for yet another reason; they are
said to have been recited in one of the most terrible
crises of the history of England and were not this time
followed by a deliverance. Charles I., it is reported,
had copied out, and recited a short time before his death,
the eloquent prayers to God, of the young heroine of
Sidney's novel. It seems that Pamela's prayer figured
among the papers that he gave with his own hand, at
the last moment, to the prelate who was attending him:
and the Puritans, Milton especially, uttered loud cries,
and saw in this reminiscence of the artist-prince, an
insult to the divine majesty. "This King," writes
the poet, "hath as it were unhallowed and unchristened
the very duty of prayer itself, by borrowing to a
Christian use prayers offered to a heathen god. Who
would have imagined so little fear in him of the true
all-seeing deity, so little reverence of the Holy Ghost,
whose office is to dictate and present our Christian
prayers, so little care of truth in his last words, or
honour to himself or to his friends, or sense of his
afflictions or of that sad hour which was upon him, as
immediately before his death to pop into the hand of
that grave bishop who attended him, for a special
relique of his saintly exercises, a prayer stolen word for
word from the mouth of a heathen woman, praying to
a heathen god, and that in no serious book, but in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
vain amatorious poem of Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Here is this prayer which is a very grave and eloquent
one, and in no way justifies the bitter reproaches
addressed to Charles by his enemies:</p>

<p>"Kneeling down, even where she stood, she thus
said: O All-seeing Light, and eternall Life of all things,
to whom nothing is either so great, that it may resist,
or so small that it is contemned: looke upon my
misery with thine eye of mercy, and let thine infinite
power vouchsafe to limit out some proportion of
deliverance unto mee, as to thee shall seeme most convenient.
Let not injurie, O Lord, triumph over mee,
and let my faults by thy hand bee corrected, and make
not mine unjust enemy the minister of thy Justice.
But yet, my God, if, in thy wisedome, this be the aptest
chastisement for my unexcusable folly; if this low
bondage be fittest for my over-high desires; if the
pride of my not enough humble heart, be thus to be
broken, O Lord, I yeeld unto thy will, and joyfully
embrace what sorrow thou wilt have me suffer. Onely
thus much let me crave of thee ... let calamity be
the exercise, but not the overthrow of my vertue: let
their power prevaile, but not prevaile to destruction:
let my greatnesse be their prey: let my paine be the
sweetnesse of their revenge: let them, if so it seem good
unto thee, vexe me with more and more punishment.
But, O Lord, let never their wickednesse have such a
hand, but that I may carry a pure minde in a pure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
body. And pausing a while: And, O most gracious
Lord, said shee, what ever become of me, preserve
the vertuous Musidorus."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Thus incidents, showing much diversity, but little
order, follow each other in great variety. There are
touching episodes, ludicrous and, to our modern ideas,
even shocking episodes, brilliant adventures, fine pastoral
scenes, and much pleasant description; Sidney
had been perfectly frank and true when he had
spoken of "his young head" and his "many many
fancies." He allows his imagination to wander; fancies
are swarming in his mind, and he is no more capable of
restraining or putting them into logical order than a
man can restrain or introduce reason into a dream.
Arcadia is sometimes in England and sometimes in
Greece; Basilius' cottage sometimes becomes Hampton
Court; there are temples and churches also; heroes are
Christians, but they believe in Mars; they act according
to the Gospel and also according to the oracles; they
are before everything men of the Renaissance. Following
his vein, Sidney, after innumerable adventures,
pastoral and warlike scenes, disappearances, unexpected
meetings, scenes of deep love, of criminal, sweet or
foolish love, comes at last to a sort of conclusion.
King Basilius drinks a soporific draught; he is given up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
as dead. Queen Gynecia is accused of being the author
of the deed; Zelmane, who has been found out to be
a man is adjudged an accomplice; both are about to be
executed. At that point, fortunately, the dead king
springs to his feet; there are explanations, embracings,
and a general pardon. Good Basilius, who alone seems
to have understood nothing of all that happened, asks
pardon of his wife and of the world at large for his
silly love for Pyrocles-Zelmane, and proclaims, unasked,
Queen Gynecia the most virtuous woman that
ever was. The Queen blushes deeply and says nothing,
but finding that the ties of her passion are now broken,
she inwardly pledges herself to live in order to justify
her husband's praise. She becomes the "example and
glory of Greece: so uncertain are mortall judgements,
the same person most infamous and most famous, and
neither justly."</p>

<p>This might be taken as a sufficient conclusion in so
loose a tale; but in that case it would mean giving up
many heroes whose fates are yet in suspense. In fact, an
"Arcadia" of this sort might be continued till doomsday.
Unless the hand of the writer grew tired, there
is no reason why it should ever end. This is, in fact,
the one and only reason Sidney puts forth as an excuse
for taking his leave; he makes no pretence of having
finished, just the reverse; for when he has married his
princes he concludes thus: "But ... the strange stories
of Artaxia and Plexirtus, Erona and Plangus, Hellen
and Amphialus, with the wonderful! chances that
befell them; the shepheardish loves of Menalcas with
Kalodulus daughter; the poore hopes of the poor
Philisides," that is, Sidney himself, "in the pursuit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
his affections; the strange continuance of Klaius and
Strephons desire; lastly the sonne of Pyrocles named
Pyrophilus, and Melidora the faire daughter of Pamela
by Musidorus, who even at their birth entred into
admirable fortunes, may awake some other spirit to
exercise his pen in that wherwith mine is already
dulled." From generation to generation the tale
might as we see, have been continued for ages: so
numerous were the wonderful adventures still to be
told.</p>

<p>The style of the book is scarcely less fanciful than
the stories it tells. It is only now and again that the
charming prose of the "Apologie for Poetrie" is to
be found in the "Arcadia." Sidney wished to remain
faithful to his theories, and he believed it possible to
write a poem in prose.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Here and there some speeches,
passionate like those of Gynecia, or noble like Pamela's
prayer, some brilliant repartee, a few observations of
exquisite charm are lasting beauties, always in their
place in all kinds of writing. Thus we meet the witty
Sidney of the "Apologie" in the description of a
spaniel, coming out of a river, who shakes off the
water from his coat "as great men doe their friends;"
Sidney, the poet and lover, appears in the description of
Philoclea entering the water "with a prettie kind of
shrugging ... like the twinkling of the fairest among
the fixed stars;" or in this expression in reference to the
fair hair of one of his heroines: "her haire&mdash;alas too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
poore a word, why should I not rather call them her
beams!"<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>But, by the side of these graceful flowers, how many
others are faded! What concessions to contemporary
taste for tinsel and excessive ornament! Sidney forgets
the rules of enduring beauty, and with the excuse that
he will never be printed, he only seeks to please his one
reader. To charm the Countess, his sister, like most
women of his time, it was necessary to put his phrases
in full dress, to place ruffs on his periods, and to make
them walk according to the rules followed in courtly
pageants. When, in spite of Sidney's earnest desire, his
book was published after his death, people were enraptured
with his ingeniously dressed out phrases. Lyly
might shake with envy without having however the right
to complain, for Sidney did not imitate him. Sidney
never liked euphuism, quite the contrary, he formally
condemns it in his "Apologie": "Now for similitudes
in certain printed discourses I think all herberists, all
stories of beasts, fowles and fishes, are rifled up, that
they may come in multitudes to wait upon any of our
conceits, which certainely is as absurd a surfet to the
eares as is possible." But his own style is scarcely less
artificial than that of Lyly, and consequently, its rules
are quite as easy to discover.</p>

<p>They consist firstly in the antithetical and cadenced
repetition of the same words in the sentences written
merely for effect; secondly, in persistently ascribing life
and feeling to inanimate objects. Sidney, it is true, as
Lyly with his euphuism, happily only employs this style
on particular occasions, when he intends to be especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
attractive and brilliant. A few specimens will afford
means of judging, and will show how difficult it was in
Shakespeare's time, even for the best educated and most
sensible men, for the sincerest admirers of the ancients,
to keep within the bounds of good taste and reason.
They might appeal to the Castalian virgins in their
invocations, but William Rogers' Elizabeth was the
Muse that rose before their eyes.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the first sort of embellishment:
"Our Basilius being so publickly happy, as to
be a prince, and so happy in that happiness, as to be a
beloved prince; and so in his private estate blessed, as
to have so excellent a wife, and so over-excellent children,
hath of late taken a course which yet makes him
more spoken of than all these blessings." In another
passage Sidney wishes to describe the perfections of a
woman; and "that which made her fairness much the
fairer, was, that it was but a fair ambassador of a most
fair mind." Musidorus considers it "a greater greatness
to give a kingdome than get a kingdome."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Phalantus
challenges his adversary to fight "either for the love of
honour or honour of his love." In many of these sentences
the same words are repeated like the rhymes of
a song, taken up from strophe to strophe, and the
sentence twists and turns, drawing and involving the
readers in its spiral curves, so that he arrives at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
end all bruised, and falls half stunned on the full
stop.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The other kind of elegance that Sidney affects is to
be found in very many authors, and it is, so to say, of
all time; poets especially indulge in it without measure;
but Sidney surpasses them all in the frequent use he
makes of it; this peculiar language is more apparent
and has still stranger effect in a prose writer than in a
poet. In his Arcady, the valleys are consoled for their
lowness by the silver streams which wind in the midst
of them; the ripples of the Ladon struggle with one
another to reach the place where Philoclea is bathing, but
those which surround her refuse to give up their fortunate
position. A shepherdess embarks: "Did you not
marke how the windes whistled, and the seas danced for
joy; how the sales did swell with pride, and all because
they had Urania?" Here is a description of a river:
"... The banks of either side seeming armes of the
loving earth, that faine would embrace it; and the river
a wanton nymph which hill would slip from it ...
There was ... a goodly cypres, who bowing her faire head
over the water, it seemed she looked into it and dressed
her green locks by that running river." One of the
heroines of the romance appears, and immediately the
flowers and the fruits experience a surprising commotion;
the roses blush and the lilies grow pale for envy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the apples perceiving her breast fall down from the trees
out of vexation, unexpected vanity on the part of this
modest fruit.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Similar conceits were at that time the fashion not only
in England, but also in Italy, in Spain, and in France.
There might still be found in France, even in the
seventeenth century, authors who described in these
terms the appearance of flowers in spring: "There
perhaps at the end of the combat, a pink all bleeding
falls from fatigue; there a rosebud, elated at the ill-success
of her antagonist, blooms with joy; there the
lily, that colossus among the flowers, that giant of
curdled cream, vain of seeing her image triumph at the
Louvre, raises herself above her companions, and looks
at them with contemptuous arrogance." The same
author, who is Cyrano de Bergerac, calls ice "an hardened
light, a petrified day, a solid nothing."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> But
contrary to what was the case in England, this style was
in France, even before Boileau and in the preceding
century, the style of bad authors. In England it is
frequently adopted by the most eminent writers, since
on many occasions it is even that of Shakespeare himself.
Besides, the combinations of sound obtained by means
of the repetition of words, added to the turgidness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of the images, give to Sidney's language in the passages
written for effect, a degree of pretension and bad taste
that Cyrano himself, in spite of his natural disposition,
could never have equalled. When both kinds of
Sidney's favourite embellishments are combined in the
same sentence, it becomes impossible to keep serious,
and it is difficult to recognize the author of the
"Apologie." Sidney thus describes wreckage floating
on the water after a sea-fight: "Amidst the precious
things were a number of dead bodies, which likewise
did not onely testifie both elements violence, but that
the chiefe violence was growne of humane inhumanity:
for their bodies were full of grisly wounds, and their
blood had, as it were, filled the wrinkles of the sea's
visage; which it seemed the see would not wash away,
that it might witnesse it is not always his fault, when
we do condemne his cruelty."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> There is indeed in
French literature a dagger celebrated for having <i>rougi
le tra&icirc;tre</i>! but what is it in comparison, and ought it
not in its turn to grow pale with envy at the thought
of this sea that will not wash itself?</p>

<p>Thus men wrote in the time of Shakespeare, guilty
himself of having made many a dagger blush and weep
in his bloody dramas: "See how my sword weeps for
the poor king's death!" says Gloucester in "Henry
VI." When Brutus stabs C&aelig;sar the blood followed the
dagger</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such was the irresistible power of fashion. Sidney who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in his "Apologie" had laughed at these extravagances
in the poets and dramatists, could not himself avoid
them when he wrote his romance. When they concern
themselves with criticism, nearly all, Shakespeare,
Sidney, and their contemporaries, are to be admired for
their moderation, wisdom, and good sense; but as soon
as they take up the pen to write their imaginative
works, intoxication overcomes their brain, a divine
intoxication that sometimes transports them to heaven,
an earthly intoxication that sometimes leads them into
bogs and gutters.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>These surprising embellishments were in no way
harmful, quite the contrary, to the success of the
"Arcadia." From the first it was extremely popular
and widely read; Sidney, who has kept his high repute
as a knight and a poet to our day, was still more famous
at first, and indeed for a long time, as a novelist. He
was before all the author of the "Arcadia."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> His
influence as such was very great, if not always very
beneficial; for his examples, as often happens, were more
readily followed than his precepts. Until the practical
Defoe worked his great reform in style, the language of
the novel was encumbered with images and unexpected
metaphors, or distorted by a pompous verbosity;
romance writers mostly looked at life and realities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
through painted glass. For this, Sidney is in some
degree responsible.</p>

<p>His book was, so to speak, a standard one; everybody
had to read it; elegant ladies now began to talk
"Arcadianism" as they had been before talking
"Euphuism." Dekker, in 1609, advises gallants to go
to the play to furnish their memories with fine sayings,
in order to be able to discourse with such refined young
persons: "To conclude, hoarde up the finest play-scraps
you can get, upon which your leane wit may most
savourly feede for want of other stuffe, when the
<i>Arcadian</i> and <i>Euphuized</i> gentlewomen have their tongues
sharpened to set upon you."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> When he has to
represent "a court-lady, whose weightiest praise is a
light wit, admired by herself, and one more," her lover,
Ben Jonson, in his "Every man out of his humour,"
makes her talk "Arcadianism." Her lover, who is
quite the man to appreciate these elegancies of speech,
being "a neat, spruce, affecting courtier, one that wears
clothes well and in fashion, practiseth by his glass how
to salute ... can post himself into credit with his merchant,
only with the gingle of his spur and the jerk of
his wand," thus describes the Arcadian music which
falls from the lips of the lady Saviolina: "She has the
most harmonious and musical strain of wit that ever
tempted a true ear ... oh! it flows from her like
nectar, and she doth give it that sweet quick grace and
exornation in the composure, that by this good air, as
I am an honest man, would I might never stir, sir, but&mdash;she
does observe as pure a phrase and use as choice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
figures in her ordinary conference as any be in the
'Arcadia.'"<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The demand for Sidney's book continued long
unabated. It was often reprinted during the seventeenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and found imitators, abbreviators
and continuators. Among its early admirers it had
that indefatigable reader of novels, William Shakespeare,
who took from it several hints, especially
from the story of the "Paphlagonian unkind king,"
which he made use of in his "King Lear."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Books
were published under cover of Sidney's name, as
"Sir Philip Sydney's Ourania";<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> others were given
away bearing as an epigraph an adaptation of two well-known
verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Nec divinam <i>Sydneida</i> tenta<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sed longe sequere et vestigia semper adora,"<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>no insignificant compliment, considering the word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
which had to make room for "Sydneida." Works
without number were dedicated to the Countess of
Pembroke, not only because she was what she was, and
a poetess of some renown, but because she was the
Mary Sidney of Arcadian fame.</p>

<p>As Sidney had stated that he did not consider his
novel finished with the marriage of his heroes, and the
reconciliation of his royal couple, continuations were
not wanting; writers who did not consider their pen
"dulled" as he had declared his own to be, volunteered
to add a further batch of adventures to the "Sidneyd."
Thus we have the "English Arcadia alluding his
beginning to Sir Philip Sidnes ending," by Gervase
Markham, 1607; a "Sixth booke to the Countesse of
Pembrokes Arcadia, written by R[ichard] B[eling] of
Lincolnes Inne," 1624; or again a "Continuation of
Sir Philip Sydney's Arcadia: wherein is handled the
loves of Amphialus and Helena ... written by a
young gentlewoman, Mrs. A. W.," 1651. Dramas
were built upon incidents in the "Arcadia"; Shakespeare
we have seen made use of it in his "King
Lear"; John Day wrote after Sidney's tale, "The
Ile of Guls," 1606, "the argument being a little
string or rivolet drawne from the full streme of the
right worthy gentleman, Sir Phillip Sydneys well
knowne Archadea."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Some years later, in 1640,
Shirley put Basilius and his court again on the stage
in his "Pastorall called the Arcadia."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p><p>Authors of poems also took their plots from stories
in Sidney's novel, one of the most popular among
those stories was the adventures of Argalus and
Parthenia; it was constantly reprinted in a separate
form, and was the subject of a long poem by the well-known
Francis Quarles, the author of the "Emblemes."
"It was," says he in his preface, "a scion taken out of
the orchard of Sir Philip Sidney of precious memory,
which I have lately graffed upon a crab-stock in mine
own.... This book differs from my former as a
courtier from a churchman." Not less did it differ
from his later books, among which the "Emblemes"
were to figure; but the pious author eases his conscience
about it by alleging "precedents for it." It cannot be
denied that if Quarles' "churchman" was very devout
his "courtier" was very worldly. He goes far beyond
Sidney in his descriptions of love, of physical love
especially, and uses in this matter a freedom of speech
and a bantering tone which reminds us much more of
the Reine de Navarre than of the author of the
"Emblemes." Such as it is, however, this poem
remains, so far as literary merit goes, one of the best
Quarles ever wrote. He scarcely ever reached again
this terseness and vivacity of style, and this <i>entrain</i>.
Having for once shut himself out of the church, and
not for long, he wanted it seems to do the best with
his time, and if he was sinning, at least to enjoy his
sin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>His contemporaries enjoyed it greatly; "Argalus
and Parthenia" went through an extraordinary number
of editions;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> some of them were very fine, and were
even illustrated with cuts. We give an example of
them showing the newly married couple sitting in
their garden to read a story:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon a day as they were closely seated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ears attending whilst his lips repeated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A story treating the renown'd adventures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And famous acts of great Alcides, enters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A messenger whose countenance did bewray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A haste too serious to admit delay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is there any necessity for reminding the reader of
the cause of the messenger's haste? Is it possible that
such world-famous adventures can be now forgotten?
The messenger was sent by King Basilius, who was
sorely pressed by his arch-enemy Amphialus. The
young hero rushes to the rescue of the Arcadian king,
but he is piteously slain in a duel with Amphialus.
Then Parthenia dresses herself as a knight, and
fights her husband's conqueror. With more verisimilitude
than is usually the case, she too is piteously
slain. And this is the end of Argalus and Parthenia.</p>

<p>But there was still more than this, and like Lyly,
Sidney had direct imitators who copied him in prose,
and tried to fashion novels after his model. All the
peculiarities of his style and of his way, or rather want,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of composition, are to be found minutely reproduced
in: "The countesse of Mountgomeries Urania; written
by the Rt. Hon. the Lady Mary Wroath, daughter of
the Rt. noble Robert earle of Leicester, and neece to
the ever famous and renowned S<sup>r</sup> Phillips Sidney Kt.
and to y<sup>e</sup> most excelent Lady Mary Countesse of
Pembroke late deceased."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> This pedigree-shaped title
is enough in itself to show what we may expect from
the performance. It is a complete and pious imitation
of Sidney's manner, especially of his defects, for they
were more easily attained. Thus we have those
repetitions of the same words which were so pleasant
to Sidney's ear, and Lady Mary Wroth has a felicity
of her own in twisting the idea into the words,
screw-wise, with a perfection her model had scarcely
ever attained: "All for others grieved; pittie extended
so, as all were carefull, but of themselves most carelesse:
yet their mutual care made them all cared for." A
very true and logical observation. Lady Mary is also
fond of giving sense and feeling to inanimate objects,
and scarcely, again, can Sidney, with his sea that will
not wash, or Cyrano with his proud giant of curdled
milk, suffer comparison with this description of a
burning tower into which a woman throws the head
of her enemy: "For her welcome [Dorileus] presented
her with the head of her enemy, which he then cut off
and gave unto her, who like Tomeris of Sithia, held it
by the haire, but gave it quickly another conclusion,
for she threw it into the midst of the flaming tower,
which then, as being in it selfe enemy to good, because
wasting good, yet hotly desiring to embrace as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
ill, and so headlongly and hastily fell on it, either to
grace it with the quickest and hottest kisses, or to
conceale such a villanous and treacherous head from
more and just punishments."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>As to the story, it is, like the "Arcadia," a tale of
shepherds who are princes, and of shepherdesses with
royal blood in their veins; there are eclogues, dialogues,
and if not much poetry at least much verse. The
events take place in Greece and in the Greek islands;
people go to the temple of Diana and to the temple of
Venus. In the last-named place they get married.
These worshippers of the deities of old are dressed
as follows. Here is the description of a man's
costume: "Then changed he his armour taking one
of azure colour, his plume crimson, and one fall of
blew in it; the furniture to his horse being of those
colours, and his device onely a cipher, which was made
of all the letters of his misstrisses name, delicately composed
within the compasse of one." Here is now a
description of the costume women wore in Lady Mary's
Greek land: "She was partly in greene too; as her
upper garment, white buskins she had, the short sleeves
which she wore upon her armes and came in sight
from her shoulders were also white, and of a glistering
stuffe, a little ruffe she had about her neck, from which
came stripps which were fastned to the edges of her
gowne, cut downe equally for length and breadth to
make it square; the strips were of lace, so as the skinne
came steallinglie through, as if desirous but afraide to
bee seane, knowing that little joy would moove desire
to have more." This clever young person had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"sworn a nymph," which prevented her getting
married for some years. Waiting for that auspicious
date a lover was offering his addresses to her, and as
Lady Wroth's Arcadia is an Arcadia with a peerage,
we are informed that this sworn nymph's lover was
"the third sonne of an earle."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>No less a man than Ben Jonson proclaimed himself
an admirer of Lady Mary; he dedicated one of his
masterpieces, "the Alchemist," to "the lady most
deserving her name and blood, Lady Mary Wroth,"
and in his "Epigrams" he addressed her as follows, his
only but sufficient excuse being that the "Urania" was
not yet written:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Madam, had all antiquity been lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All history seal'd up and fables crost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we had left us, nor by time nor place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Least mention of a Nymph, a Muse, a Grace,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The eighteenth century began, and Sidney's romance
was not yet forgotten; his book was still alive, if
one may say so, when the novel assumed its definite
shape, style and compass with Defoe, Richardson and
Fielding. Addison notices its presence in the fair
Leonora's library, among "the some few which the
lady had bought for her own use."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> It continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
then to be fashionable, and a subject of conversation.
No wonder, therefore, that between the date of
"Robinson Crusoe" and the date of "Pamela"
two more editions of the "Arcadia" were given to
the public. One of them contained engravings
after drawings by L. Ch&eacute;ron.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The other was
"moderniz'd" and was published by subscription
under the patronage of the Princess of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Sidney's novel continued to act on men's minds, and
many proofs of its influence on eighteenth-century
literature might be pointed out. That Sidney was
Richardson's first teacher in the art of the novel is
well known; that Cowper read the "Arcadia" with
delight is well known too, and he confers no mean
praise on our author when he speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"those golden times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those arcadian scenes that Maro sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sidney, warbler of poetic prose."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Examples of Sidney's style are also to be found in
several authors of that time. Consciously or not, Young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
sometimes adopts all the peculiarities of Sidney; for
example, when he writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet harmonist! and beautiful as sweet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And young as beautiful! and soft as young!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gay as soft! and innocent as gay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy (if aught happy here) as good!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fortune fond had built her nest on high."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sidney's popularity did not, of course, last so long
without encountering some opposition. For Milton,
and no wonder, the "Arcadia" was nothing but "a
vain amatorious poem," though he is fair enough to
add that it is "in that kind, full of worth and wit."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Horace Walpole was very hard upon our novelist:
"We have a tedious, lamentable, pedantic pastoral
romance," says he, in his "Royal and Noble Authors,"
"which the patience of a young virgin in love cannot
now wade through."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> It is sad to think that the once
famous "Castle of Otranto," though twenty times
shorter, requires now no smaller dose of patience.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wishes as he pines and feeds his famish&#39;d eyes.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>None the less, the "Arcadia" was popular in the
last century, and, at the same time as it attracted the
attention of fair Leonoras, it also interested and delighted
a much commoner sort of readers. It was
several times printed in an abbreviated form, and circulated,
with engravings, as a chap-book. Sometimes
the whole of the "Arcadia" was compressed into a
small volume, sometimes only an episode was given to
the public. The story of Argalus and Parthenia was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
especially popular.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The engravings, it is needless to
say, were very coarse; and if Sidney had taken little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
trouble to be historically or geographically accurate, the
wood-block makers took even less, and they offer to
our eyes an extraordinary medley of fifteenth-century
knights, Roman soldiers, gentlemen in flowing wigs and
court swords, all of them supposed to have at one time
adorned with their presence the groves of Arcady. A
few specimens of these engravers' art are here given;
no doubt the reader will be pleased to know what the
famous Argalus and Parthenia were supposed to have
been like, how the bathing of Philoclea in the Ladon
was represented, and the sorts of f&ecirc;tes and courtly
dances that enlivened the marriage of that princess.</p>

<p>More striking even than these tributes to Sidney's
merits as a novelist is the treatment awarded him in
France. The famous Du Bartas in his second "Week"
names Sidney as one of the "three firm pillars of the
English Speech." This speech, according to the French
poet, is mainly supported by Thomas More and Bacon,</p>

</div>

<p>Besides this, Sidney's romance received in France an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
homage very rare at that epoch: it was translated.
A Frenchman possessing a knowledge of the English
language was then an extraordinary phenomenon.
As late as the year 1665, no less a paper than the
"Journal des Scavans" printed a statement to the
following effect: "The Royal Society of London
publishes constantly a number of excellent works
But whereas most of them are written in the
English language, we have been unable till now
to review them in our pages. But we have at last
found an English interpreter through whose offices
it will be henceforth possible for us to enrich our
publication with the best things appearing in England."
As for Sidney, not only was he translated, but what is
not less strange, the fact provoked in France one of the
most violent literary quarrels of the time. Two translations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>of the "Arcadia," now entirely forgotten, were
published simultaneously, both in three volumes, both
adorned with engravings.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> As soon as a volume
appeared, each of the translators profited by the occasion
to write a new preface, and to repeat that his rival
was a mere plagiarist and did not know a word of
English. The other replied offering to prove such a
rare knowledge; had it been a question of Chinese or
of Hindustani they could not have boasted more noisily
of their unique acquaintance with so mysterious an
idiom. Each appealed to his patroness, who was, in
either case, no ordinary woman: the one had dedicated
his work to Diane de Chateaumorand (D'Urf&eacute;'s Diane),
who had indeed the right to judge of Arcadias; the
other invoked the authority of the Queen-mother,
Marie de Medicis, by whose express command he had
carried on his work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>Baudoin, who had been the first to turn the
"Arcadia" into French, published it in 1624, prefixing
to it this remark, flattering to Sidney's memory,
but which shows how very little his language was
known in France: "Merely the desire of understanding
so rare a book caused me to go to England,
where I remained for two years in order to gain a
knowledge of it."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;the glorious entertainments that graced<br />
the happy nuptials.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Two years! immediately retorts the publisher of
the other translation; we can do better than that:
the author of the work that we publish is Mademoiselle
Genevi&egrave;ve Chappelain, and what guarantees does she not
offer! "She has the honour to have lived more than
seven years at the court of the King of Great Britain,
in the suite of the Countess of Salisbury, who esteemed
her as no ordinary young girl, but as a very well-bred
demoiselle who had been presented to her with good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
credentials, and who was descended from a race that has
given us great men: verily, and women, too, that the
muses have deigned to favour." This is a little like the
argument of Scud&eacute;ry, boasting, ten years later, of his
noble birth in order to prove to poor Pierre Corneille
that he is the better poet of the two, and that the
"Cid" is worth nothing.</p>

<p>But something better still follows, and here the
worthy publisher somewhat betrays himself: "If she
has not been able to learn the language of the
country in which she has lived for more than seven
years, and nearly always with great ladies: how, I beg
of you, could those who have only lived there two
years, and among the common people, know the
language? I do not wish to offend any one by this
notice, which I thought it necessary to make only to
defend a young lady <i>who is my near relation</i>."</p>

<p>Baudoin maintains his statement, and defies his rivals
to translate Sidney's verse, and he enumerates the precautions
he himself has taken, precautions which
certainly ought to satisfy the reader as regards his
accuracy. Not only did he live for two years in England,
but, he says, "I secured the assistance of a French
gentleman of merit and learning, who has been good
enough to explain to me the whole of the first book.
I have acted in such a way as to procure two different
versions of it in order to produce one good one." And
he has done even something more: "I have always had
near me one of my friends to whom this tongue was as
familiar as our own; he has taken the trouble to elucidate
for me any doubts I may have had." In truth, he
could hardly have surrounded himself with more light,
but then, what an arduous task to translate from English!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Baudoin's adversaries were in no way intimidated by
this display; firstly, they had had the assistance of
exactly the same gentleman; it appears that a second
equally learned was not to be found; secondly, Mdlle.
Chappelain also showed her translation to persons who
knew both languages, and they found her work perfect;
lastly, and what more can be required? she sends a
challenge to Baudoin and his accomplices, and invites
them to a decisive combat: "She is ready to
show that she knows the English language better than
they, and they would not dare to appear in order to
speak it with her in the presence of persons capable of
judging." Baudoin does not appear, indeed, to have
accepted this challenge, but neither does it seem to have
discouraged him. He closes the preface of his last
volume with this poetical apostrophe to those who are
envious of his reputation: "By the mouth of good
wits&mdash;Apollo holds you in contempt,&mdash;Troop so ignorant
and bold:&mdash;For you profane his beauteous gifts,&mdash;And
cause thistles to spring up&mdash;In the midst of your
Arcady."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>What astonishes us now, when we follow the vicissitudes
of the long-forgotten dispute of these two
writers is that so much passion should have been
expended over Sidney's romance, however great might
be its merit; while the attention of no one in France
was attracted by Shakespeare and the inimitable group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of dramatists of his time. No Baudoin, no Genevi&egrave;ve
Chappelain disputed the honour of translating "Hamlet,"
and a century was still to elapse before so much as
Shakespeare's name should figure in a book printed in
France.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>This double translation of the "Arcadia" did not,
however, pass unnoticed, far from it; and from time to
time we find the name of Sidney reappearing in French
books, while the giants of English literature continued
entirely unknown on the continent. When
Charles Sorel satirized the long-winded romances of his
time in his "Berger Extravagant," he did not forget
Sidney, who figures among the authors alternately
praised and criticized in the disputation between Clarimond
and Philiris. The criticism is not very severe,
and compared with the treatment inflicted on other
authors, it would seem that Sorel wished to show
courtesy to a foreigner who had been invited, so to say,
as a visitor to France by his translators.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Copies of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Sidney's original "Arcadia" crept into France, and are
to be found in rather unexpected places. Thus a copy
of the edition of 1605 is to be seen in the National
Library in Paris, with the <span class='greek' title='Ph Ph'> &#934; &#934;</span> of surintendant Fouquet
on the cover. The way in which the letters are
interlaced shows that the book did not come from Fouquet's
own library, but from the library of the Jesuits,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
to whom he had given a yearly income of 6,000 livres,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and who, in memory of their benefactor, stamped thus
books purchased from this fund.</p>

<p>In France, too, as well as in England, the "Arcadia"
was turned into a play. Antoine Mareschal, a contemporary
of Corneille and the author of such dramas as
"La g&eacute;n&eacute;reuse Allemande ou le triomphe de l'amour,"
1631, the "Railleur ou la satyre du temps," 1638,
the "Mauzol&eacute;e," 1642, derived a tragi-comedy, in
five acts, and in verse from the "Arcadia." The piece,
which, if the author is to be believed, made a great
sensation in Paris, was called the "Cour Berg&egrave;re," and
was dedicated to Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester,
ambassador of England to France, and brother to Sir
Philip. It appeared in 1640; it was thus later than
the "Cid." None the less, it exhibits the phenomenon
of several deaths on the stage; but the ridiculous
manner in which these deaths are introduced could only
strengthen Corneille in his scruples. The wicked
Cecropia, standing on a terrace at the back of the
stage, moves without seeing the edge, and falls head
foremost on the boards, exclaiming:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! je tombe, et l'enfer a mon corps entrain&eacute; ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Je d&eacute;teste le ciel! Ah! je meurs enrag&eacute;e!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following century Sidney was still remembered
in France. In his "M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave;
l'histoire de la R&eacute;publique des lettres," Niceron mentions
the "Arcadia" as "a romance full of intelligence
and very well written in the author's language."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
Florian knew him and held him in great honour; he
names him with D'Urf&eacute;, Montemayor, and Cervantes,
as being, as it were, one of his literary ancestors,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and
the fact is not without importance; for Florian, continuing,
as he did, Sidney's tradition, and trying in his
turn to write poems in prose, stands as a link between
the pastoral writers of the sixteenth century and the
author who was the last to compose prose epics in
our time: the author of "Les Martyrs" and of that
American Arcadia called "Atala"&mdash;Chateaubriand.</p>

<p>Dedication of the "Shepheardes Calender." Sidney seems to
have had a right and not over-enthusiastic appreciation of Spenser's
eclogues; in his "Apologie for Poetrie" he is content to say that
"the Sheapheardes Kalender hath much poetrie in his eglogues:
indeede worthy the reading if I be not deceived" (Arber's reprint,
p. 62).</p></div>

(quoted below, p. 233).</p></div>

Sidney wrote also for festivities of the same kind a "Dialogue

(the seat of his sister the Countess of Pembroke). Both works are
to be found in divers old editions of the "Arcadia" (<i>e.g.</i>, the

Sidnei," London, 1590, 4to. Several of the numerous poems
inserted in the "Arcadia" are written in classical metres; for
Sidney took part with several of his contemporaries in the futile
effort made in England as in France to apply to modern languages
the rules of ancient prosody. The pages referred to in the following
notes are those of the edition of 1633, "now the eighth time
published with some new additions."</p></div>

Meres in his "Paladis Tamia," 1598. She helped her brother in
translating the Psalms of David and published various works, one of
them being a translation of one of Garnier's neo-classical tragedies:
"The tragedie of Antonie," written in 1590, printed in 1595,
which contains, conformably to Sidney's taste, messengers, monologues
and choruses. It begins thus in the regular classical style
of that time:</p>

Middle Ages; ladies following as pages their own lovers, unknown
to them, abound in the French medi&aelig;val literature; one, <i>e.g.</i>,
is to be found in the "Tr&egrave;s chevaleureux Comte d'Artois," a
very old tale, of which we have only a version of the fifteenth
century, but which existed long before, and supplied Boccaccio
with the groundwork of his story of Giletta of Narbonne. From
Boccaccio, this tale was transferred by Paynter to his "Palace of
Pleasure," and from this work, by Shakespeare, to the stage, under
the name of "All's well." Sidney's model Montemayor gives the
same part to play, as we have seen, to his pretended shepherdess
Felismena, who follows as his page her lover Don Felix.</p></div>

the repetition of words. Here is another example: "Is it to be
imagined that Gynecia, a woman, though wicked, yet witty, would
have attempted and atchieved an enterprise no lesse hazzardous
than horrible without having some counsellor in the beginning and
some comforter in the performing?" (book v. p. 466).</p></div>

portraits of Sidney and of his sister. The second translation appeared
at the bookseller's, Robert Fouet, in 1625, in the same size;
it is ornamented with pretty engravings. Of its three parts the
first was the work of "un brave gentilhomme," and the two others
of Mdlle. Genevi&egrave;ve Chappelain. It is needless to observe that
the great success of D'Urf&eacute;'s "Astr&eacute;e" had much to do with this
zeal for translating Sidney's pastoral novel.

Baudoin, who died in 1650, was the translator of various other
foreign works, among which part of the works of Bacon. Sir
Kenelm Digby, whose fondness for romances was great, had in his
library a copy of the "Arcadia" in French; this was Baudoin's
translation, and it is one of the items of the catalogue drawn in
view of the sale of his library ("Bibliotheca Digbeiana," London,
1680, 4to). There was, a little later, a translation in German: "Arcadia
... in unser Hochteutsche Sprach ... ubersetzt," by Theocritus
von Hirschberg [<i>i.e.</i>, Martin Opitz], Francfort, 1629, 4to.</p></div>

his defence of romances, Philiris answers: "Quant a l'Arcadie de
Sidney, apr&egrave;s avoir pass&eacute; la mer pour nous venir voir, je suis
marry que Clarimond la re&ccedil;oive avec un si mauvais compliment.
S'il n'entend rien aux amours de Strephon et de Clajus, il faut qu'il

fantaisies amoureuses, l'on void les impertinences des romans et de

translated into English: "The extravagant shepherd. The anti-romance,
or the history of the shepherd Lysis," by John Davies, of
Kidwelly; London, 1653, fol. The book has very curious plates;
Davies in his preface is extremely hard upon Sidney, and heaps

(dated 1665) of his library, drawn up after his committal,
shows that he had a fairly large number of English books. He
was the earliest known French possessor of a Shakespeare. The
catalogue, it is true, reveals the fact that he preserved it "in his
garret":</p>

<p>The second in date of the French possessors of copies of Shakespeare
was, strange to say, no less a person than the patron of
Racine and Boileau, the Roi-Soleil himself. Looking over, some
time ago, at the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, the original manuscript
slips made in 1684 by the royal librarian, Nicolas Cl&eacute;ment, for
his catalogue of the books confided to his care, I found one inscribed:
"Will. Shakspeare, poeta Anglicus. Opera poetica, continentia
tragoedias, comoedias et historiolas, Anglice, Londres, Th.
Cotes, 1632, fol." And to this, considering that he had to deal
with a thoroughly unknown person, Cl&eacute;ment was careful to add
a note that people might be informed what was to be thought
of the poet. This is (so far as now known) the earliest French
allusion to Shakespeare: "Ce po&egrave;te anglois a l'imagination ass&egrave;s
belle, il pense naturellement; mais ces belles qualitez sont
obscurcies par les ordures qu'il m&ecirc;le dans ses com&eacute;dies."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THOMAS NASH; THE PICARESQUE AND REALISTIC
NOVEL.</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>"There is nothing beside the goodnesse of God,
that preserves health so much as honest mirth,
especially mirth used at dinner and supper,
and mirth toward bed.... Therefore, considering this
matter, that mirth is so necessary a thing for man,
I published this booke ... to make men merrie....
Wherefore I doe advertise every man in avoiding
pensivenesse, or too much study or melancholic, to
be merrie with honesty in God and for God, whom I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
humbly beseech to send us the mirth of heaven.
Amen."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Such was the advice attributed to a man
whose opinion should carry weight, for he had been
a "doctor of physicke" and had published with great
success a "Breviary of helth" which was a household
book in his time.</p>

<p>The pensive Sir Philip Sidney was, as we have seen,
of a very different turn of mind. He did not live
to read the above wise counsels, but he had had the
opinion of his friend Languet on this subject, and that
had been of no avail. His propensity to overthinking
is apparent in many places in his writings, especially
in his "Arcadia," where he made so little use of the
comical elements he had himself introduced into it.
The main incident in his book, the assignation given
by Zelmane to both Basilius and Gynecia and the
"mistakes of a night" which follow, would have been
from any other pen, only too comical. It is, in fact,
the character it bears in Shirley's drama, and it has
the same in the many modern plays founded on similar
mistakes, plays which serve to improve, according to
Andrew Borde's prescription, if not the morals, at least
the health of the "Palais Royal" audiences of to-day.
With Sidney, the comic is a vulgar style; he very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
rarely risks any jests, a portrait of a cowardly peasant,
or of an injured husband.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> One of his best attempts
in this style is a character in his masque of the "Lady
of May," the pedant Rombus, who gives quotations
which are always wrong and like Rabelais' scholar, who
belongs to "the alme, inclyte and celebrate academy,
which is vocitated Lutetia," is careful to make use of
nothing but quasi-Latin words. In order to relate
how he has been unmercifully whipped by shepherds
he declares: "Yet hath not the pulchritude of my
vertues protected me from the contaminating hands of
these Plebeians; for comming, <i>solummodo</i> to have parted
their sanguinolent fray, they yeelded me no more
reverence, than if I had beene some <i>pecorius asinus</i>."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
But that is an easy way to amuse, and, even at that
epoch, not very new. Rabelais had made a better use
of it before Sidney, and after him, without mentioning
Shakespeare, Cyrano de Bergerac furnished more
laughable specimens. No phrase of Rombus equals
the order given by the Pedant to his son when sending
him to Venice to engage in commerce: "Since thou hast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
never desired to drink of the pool engendered by the
hoof of the feathered horse,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and as the lyric harmony
of the learned murderer of Python has never inflated
thy speech, try if in merchandise Mercury will lend
thee his Caduceus. So may the turbulent &AElig;olus be
as affable to thee as to the peaceful nests of halcyons.
In short, Charlot, thou must go." Sidney kept entirely
to these ineffectual attempts, and had no desire to go
further in his examination of the ridiculous side of
ordinary men.</p>

<p>This study was undertaken by several of his contemporaries.
One of the peculiarities of this first
awakening of the novel in England, is that it was
nearly complete and produced, if not standard masterpieces,
at least curious examples of nearly all the
different kinds of novel with which later writers have
made us familiar. We have seen already how Lyly
depicted courtly life, and tried to use the novel as a
vehicle for wise and philosophical advice; how Greene,
Lodge and Sidney busied themselves with romantic
tales; how Greene tried to describe the realities of
life in some of his autobiographical stories. There
was something more to do in this line, and the Elizabethan
drama offers innumerable examples of it; but
it is not so well known that in the time of Shakespeare,
there were in circulation, besides romantic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
chivalrous tales, regular realistic novels, the main
object of which was to paint to the life ordinary men
and characters. These are the least known, but not
the least remarkable of the attempts made by Shakespeare's
contemporaries in the direction of the novel as
we understand it.</p>

<p>Works of this kind took for the most part the
shape to which has been applied the name of <i>picaresque</i>.
This was, like the pastoral, imported into England
from abroad: in the sixteenth century it shone with
particular brilliance in Spain. The incessant wars of
that vast empire on whose frontiers the sun never set,
had favoured the multiplication of adventurers, to-day
great lords, to-morrow beggars; one day dangerous,
another day contemptible or ridiculous. "Such
people there are living and flourishing in the world,
Faithless, Hopeless, Charityless: let us have at them,
dear friends, with might and main. Some there are,
and very successful too, mere quacks and fools: and
it was to combat and expose such as those, no doubt
that <i>Laughter</i> was made." So wrote in our time
William Thackeray,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> who seems to have considered
that the age of the <i>picaro</i> had not yet passed away,
and that the novelist might still with advantage turn
his attention to him. However that may be the great
time for the rascal, the rogue, the knave, for all those
persons of no particular class whom adventures had
left poor and by no means peaceable, for the <i>picaro</i>
in all his varieties, was the sixteenth century. A
whole literature was devoted to describing the fortunes
of these strange persons; Spain gave it its name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of <i>picaresque</i> and spread it abroad but did not
altogether invent it. The rogue, who plays tricks
which deserve a hanging, had already filled and enlivened
tales in several languages. Master Reynard, in
that romance of the Middle Ages of which he is the
hero, is something like a <i>picaro</i>. Another of them
is Til Eulenspiegel, whose adventures related in
German furnished, in 1515, the subject of a very
popular book;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> even Panurge could at need be placed
in this great family. Only, with Master Reynard we
live in the world of animals and the romance is
allegorical; with Til Eulenspiegel we find no truth,
no probability, merely tricks for tricks' sake, and how
coarse they are! With Panurge, we are distracted
from the <i>picaro</i> by all the philosophic and fantastic
digressions of an extensive tale in which he is not the
principal hero. But with the Spaniards, with Lazarillo
de Tormes, Guzman d'Alfarache<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and the rest, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<i>picaro</i> holds a place in literature which is peculiarly
his own. Faithless, shameless, if not joyless, the
plaything of fortune, by turn valet, gentleman, beggar,
courtier, thief, we follow him into all societies. From
hovel to palace he goes first, opens the doors and
shows us the characters. There is no plot more
simple or flexible, none that lends itself better to the
study of manners, of abuses, of social eccentricities.
The only defect is that, in order to abandon himself
with necessary good will to the caprices of Fate, and
in order to be able to penetrate everywhere, the hero
has necessarily little conscience and still less heart;
hence the barrenness of the greater part of the
picaresque romances and the weak <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, entirely incidental,
reserved in these works for sentiment.</p>

<p>The success of these Spanish romances was immediate
and lasting throughout Europe. "Lazarillo"
and "Guzman" were translated into several languages,
and were greatly appreciated here and abroad. "What!
sir," says the Burgundian lord in "Francion,"<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> "is
it thus that you cruelly deprive me of the narration
of your more amusing adventures? Do you not know
that these commonplace actions are infinitely entertaining,
and that we take delight in listening even to those
of scoundrels and rascals like Guzman d'Alfarache<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and Lazarillo de Tormes?" "Guzman" had in France
several illustrious translators; the ponderous author of
"La Pucelle" and famous academician, Chapelain, was
one of them; another was Le Sage who, before
penning this translation, had revived and doubled the
popularity of the picaresque novel in publishing his
"Gil Blas."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> In Germany, Grimmelshausen, following
the same models, wrote in the seventeenth century
his "Simplicissimus." In England "Guzman" was
several times translated; "Lazarillo" was continually
reprinted during two centuries, and original romances
of this kind were published here, among others, by
Thomas Nash, in the sixteenth, by Richard Head in the
seventeenth, by Defoe and Smollett, in the eighteenth
century. The initiative of Nash and his group
was all the more important and meritorious because
before them the comic element was greatly wanting in
the English prose romance; amusing stories in the
manner of the French had found translators sometimes,
but not imitators; the authors of Arcadias were especially
concerned in depicting noble sentiments, and the
gift of observation possessed by the English people ran
the risk of being for a long time exercised nowhere
but on the stage, or in metrical tales, or in moral
essays.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Thomas Nash made one of that group of young
men, full of spirit, fire and imagination, who shone
during the first part of Shakespeare's career, who
fancied they could live by their pen, and who died
prematurely and miserably. Nash was about thirty-three
years old when he died in 1600; Marlowe was
twenty-nine, Peele thirty, Greene thirty-two.</p>

<p>Nash was born at Lowestoft in 1567:<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> "The head
towne in that iland is Leystofe, in which, bee it
knowne to all men, I was borne; though my father
sprung from the Nashes of Herefordshire;" a family
that could "vaunt longer petigrees than patrimonies."
He studied at Cambridge, in St. John's College, "in
which house once I tooke up my inne for seven yere
together lacking a quarter, and yet love it still, for it
is and ever was, the sweetest nurse of knowledge in all
that university."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> "Saint Johns in Cambridge," says
he at another place, "at that time was an universitie
within it selfe ... having, as I have hearde grave men
of credite report, more candles light in it everie winter
morning before foure of the clocke than the foure of
clocke bell gave stroakes."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Like Greene and Sidney, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
imbibed early a passionate taste for literature; he learnt
the classical languages and foreign ones too, at least
French and Italian, and enjoyed much miscellaneous
reading; old English literature, Mandeville, Chaucer,
Gower, Skelton, were not forgotten. Following then the
usual course, he seems to have travelled on the continent,
to have visited Italy and Germany,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and to have come
home, also according to custom, to rush into literature:
by which word was then habitually understood fame,
poverty, quarrels, imprisonment, and an early death.
Not one of these items was wanting in Nash's career.
A prolific and easy writer, he tried his hand at all
kinds of work, composing them rapidly and with
visible pleasure, always ready to laugh at the follies of
others, sometimes at his own, not melancholy like
Sidney, nor downcast like Greene. He very rarely
alludes to his miseries without a smile, though he could
not help regretting the better things he might have
done if Fortune had not been so adverse, "had
I a ful-sayld gale of prosperity." But "my state is so
tost and weather-beaten, that it hath nowe no anchor-holde
left to cleave unto."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Having said thus much, he
immediately resumes his cheerful countenance and in
the best of spirits and in perfect good humour goes on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
describing the great city of Yarmouth, the metropolis
of the Red Herring.</p>

<p>With this turn of mind and an inexhaustible fund
of wit, satire, and gaiety, he published numerous
pamphlets, threw himself impetuously into the Martin
Marprelate controversy (in which another novelist,
Lyly, was also taking part); sustained a rude warfare
against Gabriel Harvey;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> wrote a dissertation on
social manners: the "Anatomie of absurditie," 1589;
a disquisition with an autobiographical turn, which
may be compared with those Greene has left; "Pierce
Penilesse his supplication to the Divell," 1592 (it had
great success, and was even translated into French,
"maimedly translated," says Nash,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> probably with
great truth); a novel "The unfortunate traveller or the
life of Jack Wilton," 1594, which has most undeservedly
remained until now the least known of
his works; a drama, "The Isle of dogs," 1597,
which is lost, and for which the author was sent to
prison; a curious and amusing discourse "in praise
of the red herring," 1599; and many other books,
pamphlets, and works of all kinds.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p><p>Constantly entangled in quarrels, in such a way sometimes
that the authorities had to interfere&mdash;for example,
in his war with Gabriel Harvey, when the destruction
of the books of both was ordered&mdash;he preserved to the
last his good humour and his taste for people and
authors who knew what it was to laugh. Curiously
enough, he combined this taste with an intense fondness
for pure literature and for lyrical poetry. Rabelais
is among his masters, and so is Aretino, "one of
the wittiest knaves that ever God made." Tarleton
the jester is among his friends, and so is Kemp,
the Dogberry of Shakespeare's "Much Ado," the
Peter of "Romeo and Juliet," the famous dancer who
performed a morris dance from London to Norwich.
And at the same time he bestows with unbounded
enthusiasm heartfelt praises upon Spenser, "heavenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Spenser"; upon "immortal" Sidney, whose "Astrophel
and Stella" he himself published in 1591; and upon
Marlowe, as the author of the exquisite Hero and
Leander poem, "Leander and Hero of whome divine
Mus&aelig;us sung and a diviner muse then him, Kit
Marlow."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>With all his fondness for merry authors, Nash can
discern true poetry, and he adores it. If by chance,
in the midst of an angry satirical disquisition, the word
poetry comes to his pen, he is suddenly transformed, he
smiles, he melts; nothing is left in him but human
sympathies. "Nor is poetry an art where of there is
no use in a man's whole life but to describe discontented
thoughts and youthfull desires, for there is
no study but it dooth illustrate and beautifie.... To
them that demaund what fruites the poets of our time
bring forth, or wherein they are able to approve themselves
necessarie to the state, thus I answere: first
and formost, they have cleansed our language from
barbarisme, and made the vulgar sort, here in London,
which is the fountaine whose rivers flowe round about
England, to aspire to a richer puritie of speach than is
communicated with the comminalty of any nation
under heaven."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> When a man like Nash could write
in such a strain, with a passion for vernacular literature
scarcely equalled at any time, there was obviously
growing among that "vulgar sort, here in London," a
public for any great man that might appear, a public
for William Shakespeare himself, who was just then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
beginning to reach celebrity. Nash does not doubt
that it is possible for English to become a classical language,
however rude the garb it first bore. According to
Nash, Surrey was "a prince in content because a poet
without peere. Destinie never defames her selfe but
when she lets an excellent poet die: if there bee any
sparke of Adams paradized perfection yet emberd vp
in the breasts of mortall men, certainely God hath
bestowed that his perfectest image on poets." Differing
from Francis Bacon and a few of the grave dignitaries
of literature, he has faith in that group of artists in
the first rank of whom he placed heavenly Spenser,
who can well bear comparison with any author of
France, Italy, or Spain. "Neither is he the only
swallow of our summer."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>This fondness for pure literature, for musical verse
and lyrical poetry, explains how, satirist as he was,
Nash had numerous friends whose feelings towards him
were nothing short of tenderness. "Sweet boy,"
"Sweet Tom," are not usual expressions towards a
satirist; they are, however, applied to Nash both by
Greene and by Francis Meres, because there was in
Nash's mind something besides the customary rancour
of born satirists, "The man," said Shakespeare,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The man that has no music in himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The motions of his spirit are as dull as night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his affections dark as Erebus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no such man be trusted."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very different sort of a man was Nash; his friends
found that he could be "mov'd with concord of sweet
sounds," and that he could be trusted. As he survived
Sidney at a time when a few years meant much
for English literature, he could form a far more
favourable judgment of the drama than the well-known
one in the "Apologie." The ridiculous performances
noticed by Sidney had not disappeared, but
they were not the only ones to be seen on the stage;
dramas of the highest order were being played; actors
rendered them with becoming dignity, and, curiously
enough to our ideas, Nash adds as a special praise that
women were excluded from among their number:
"Our players are not as the players beyond sea, a sort
of squirting baudie comedians, that have whores and
common curtezans to play womens parts, and forbeare
no immodest speech or unchast action that may procure
laughter; but our sceane is more stately furnisht than
ever it was in the time of Roscius, our representations
honorable and full of gallant resolution, not consisting
like theirs of a Pantaloun, a whore and a Zanie, but of
emperours, kings and princes whose true tragedies,
<i>Sophocleo cothurno</i> they do vaunt."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> In the next
century, women were allowed to replace on the English
stage the newly-shaven young fellows who used to play
Juliet and Titania; we are happy to say that so indecent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
a practice was due to foreign influence. We have
Prynne's authority for believing that the first women
who had the audacity to appear before a London
audience were French. This happened in 1629 at the
Blackfriars theatre. It is true that not long after,
to make up, as it were, for lost time, plays were
performed in England in which all the parts were taken
by women; it is not known whether on that occasion
they were French.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Another very important characteristic in Nash is the
high ideal he has shaped for himself of the art of
writing, not only in verse, but in plain prose. At a
time when English prose was scarcely acknowledged
to be capable of artistic treatment, and when rules,
regulations and theories had, as is generally believed,
very little hold upon writers, it is interesting to notice
that such an author as Nash, with his stirring style and
unbridled pen, with his prison and tavern life, understood
that words had a literary value of their own.
They were not to be taken at random, but chosen with
care. His theory may on some points be disputed, but
it is certainly interesting to note that he had a theory
at all. First, he desires that a man shall write in his
own vein and not copy others, especially those who by
their vogue and peculiarities, such as Lyly or Greene,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
were easiest of reach and the most tempting to imitate.
He strongly defends himself from having ever done
anything of this sort; on the contrary, more than
once appeals were made to him to give judgment in
literary matters:</p>

<p>"Is my style like Greenes, or my jeasts like Tarletons?</p>

<p>"Do I talke of any counterfeit birds, or hearbes
or stones?... This I will proudly boast ... that the
vaine which I have ... is of my own begetting and
cals no man father in England but myselfe, neither
Euphues, nor Tarlton, nor Greene.</p>

<p>"Not Tarlton nor Greene but have beene contented
to let my simple judgment overrule them in some
matters of wit. Euphues I read when I was a little ape
in Cambridge, and I then thought it was <i>ipse ille</i>: it
may be excellent still for ought I know, but I lookt
not on it this ten yeare: but to imitate it I abhorre."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>His vocabulary is very rich; he has always a variety
of words at his disposal and uses often two or three the
better to impress our minds with the idea in his own.
He coins at need new words or fetches them from
classical or foreign languages. He does not do this in
an off-hand way, but on purpose and wilfully; he
possessed much of that curious care for and delight
in words which is one of the characteristics of the
men of the Renaissance. To deal with words was
in itself a pleasure for them; they liked to mould,
to adopt, to combine, to invent them. Word painting
delighted them; Nash has an extreme fondness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
for it, and satirical and comical as he is, he often
astonishes us by the poetic gracefulness of his combinations
of words. In this as in many other particulars
he imitates, <i>longe sequens</i>, the master he seems to have
admired above others, Rabelais, who, in the tempestuous
roll of his diverse waters, sometimes washes up on to
the sand pearls fit to adorn the crown of any lyrical poet.
Fishes appear in Nash's otherwise unpoetical prose as
"the sea's finny freeholders;" the inhabitants of a port
town do not sow corn, "their whole harvest is by sea;"
they plough "the glassy fieldes of Thetis." He has an
instinctive hatred for abstract terms; he wants expressive
words, words that shine, that breathe, that
live. Instead of saying that Henry III. <i>granted</i> a charter
and certain privileges in a particular year of his
<i>reign</i>, he will write that "he <i>cheard up their blouds</i>
with two charters more, and in Anno 1262 and forty-five
of his <i>courte keeping</i>, he permitted them to wall
in their towne."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The pleasure of replacing stale,
commonplace expressions by rare, picturesque, live
ones, and in lieu of a plain sentence to give an allegorical
substitute, has so much attraction for Nash, that clear-sighted
as he is, he cannot always avoid the ordinary
defects of this particular style, defects which
he has in common with many of his contemporaries,
not excluding Shakespeare himself, namely, obscurity
and sometimes bad taste.</p>

<p>Another of Nash's tendencies, which he has most
decidedly in common with Rabelais, consists in the
use of a number of expressions in the same sentence
for the same idea. Of course one carefully chosen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
word would be enough; such a man as M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, to
take an example at the other extremity of the line,
picks out the one term he wants, puts it in its place;
word and place fit exactly; there is nothing to add or
desire. Not so Rabelais; not so either his admirer
Nash; the newly-awakened curiosities of the Renaissance
were too young as yet, too fresh and strong upon
them, to be easily kept down by rule and reflection.
Literature too was young then, and young things are
endowed with eyes that stare and admire more easily
than old ones. When entering their word-shop, writers
of the sixteenth century were fain to take this word,
and this other too, and yet that one more; and when
on the threshold, about to go, they would turn and
take two or three again. There are pages in Rabelais
and pages in Nash where most of the important words
are supplemented and fortified with a number of others
placed there at our disposal as alternatives or substitutes,
for the pleasure of our ears and eyes, in case we might
like them better. Nash has to express this very simple
idea: Look at Yarmouth, what a fine town it is! Well,
it owes all it is to the red herring. This he formulates
in the following manner with quite a Rabelaisian
mixture of native and half Latin words and iterations
for most terms of importance: "Doe but convert,
said hee, the slenderest twinckling reflexe of your eye-sight
to this flinty ringe that engirtes it, these towred
walles, port-cullizd gates, and gorgeous architectures that
condecorate and adorne it, and then perponder of the red
herringes priority and prevalence, who is the onely inexhaustible
mine that hath raised and begot all this, and,
minutely, to riper maturity, fosters and cherisheth it."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>
<p>Some critics of his time abused Nash for the liberties
he took with the vocabulary, especially for his foreign
and compound words. He was ready with this half-serious,
half-jocose answer: "To the second rancke of
reprehenders, that complain of my boystrous compound
wordes, and ending my Italionate coyned verbes all in
<i>ize</i>," such as "tympanize; tirannize," says he elsewhere;
"thus I replie: That no winde that blowes strong but
is boystrous; no speech or wordes of any power or
force to confute or perswade, but must be swelling and
boystrous. For the compounding of my wordes,
therein I imitate rich men, who having gathered store
of white single money together, convert a number of
those small little scutes into great peeces of gold, such
as double Pistoles and Portugues. Our English tongue
of all languages, most swarmeth with the single money
of monosillables, which are the onely scandall of it.
Bookes written in them and no other seeme like shopkeepers'
bookes, that containe nothing else save halfe-pence,
three-farthings, and two-pences. Therefore what
did me I, but having a huge heape of those worth lesse
shreds of small English in my <i>pia maters</i> purse, to
make the royaller shew with them to men's eye, had
them to the compounders immediately, and exchanged
them foure into one, and others into more, according to
the Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Nash had a particular literary hatred for mere
empty bombast. His love for high-sounding words
with a meaning was not greater than his aversion for
big sounds without one. Even his friend Marlowe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
does not escape his censure for having trespassed in this
particular beyond the limits of good taste. Nash
wonders "how eloquent our gowned age is growen of
late," and he has nothing but contempt for those "vainglorious

<p>His ideas regarding the art of novel writing are very
liberal, and he accepts as belonging to literature many
specimens we should sternly reject. The one point to
remember, however, is that he does not accept them
all; he draws the line somewhere, and in that age when
the novel was in its infancy, there was merit in
doing even no more than this. He is very hard upon
the old medi&aelig;val romances, which it is true he seems
to have known only through the abridged and degenerate
texts circulated in his time, for the amusement of
idle readers. He readily endorses the moral views of
Ascham about them, adding however, what is more
interesting for us, some literary criticism: "What els
I pray you, doe these bable booke-mungers endevor
but to repaire the ruinous wals of Venus court, to
restore to the worlde that forgotten legendary licence of
lying, to imitate a fresh the fantasticall dreames of those
exiled Abbie-lubbers [<i>i.e.</i>, the monks] from whose idle
pens proceeded those worne out impressions of the
feigned no where acts of Arthur of the rounde table,
Arthur of litle Brittaine, Sir Tristram, Hewon of Burdeaux,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>the Squire of low degree, the four sons of
Amon, with infinite others.... Who is it that reding
Bevis of Hampton, can forbeare laughing, if he marke
what scambling shyft he makes to end his verses a like?
I will propound three or foure payre by the way for the
readers recreation:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Every reader will agree with Nash, I suppose, in
condemning this as balderdash.</p>

<p>Endowed thus with artistic theories of his own, with
an intense love of literature, with an inborn gaiety and
faculty of observation, Nash added to the collection of
novels of the Shakespearean era, not another Bevis of
Hampton, but his "Jack Wilton,"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> the best specimen
of the picaresque tale in English literature
anterior to Defoe. His romance, written in the form of
memoirs, according to the usual rule of the picaresque,
is dedicated to the Earl of Southampton, under whose
patronage Shakespeare had already placed his "Venus
and Adonis." It has the defect of all the romances of
the time, in England as elsewhere: it is incoherent and
badly put together. But it contains excellent fragments,
two or three capital portraits of individuals which show
careful observation, and a few solidly constructed scenes
like the vengeance of Cutwolfe which allow us to foresee
that one day the dramatic power of the English
genius, worn out doubtless by a too long career on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
stage, instead of dying altogether, will be revived in
the novel.</p>

<p>Nash, after the manner employed by More in his
"Utopia," by Greene in his "Ciceronis amor," and
in our age, with a splendour of fame to which several
generations have already borne testimony, by Sir Walter
Scott, introduces historical personages in his fiction.
The page Jack Wilton, the hero of the tale, a little
superior by his rank to the ordinary <i>picaro</i> has, like
Gil Blas, little money in his pocket and a few odds
and ends of Latin in his head; he distributes in his
conversation the trite quotations that have remained
by him, skilfully enough to persuade the vulgar that
he does not belong to their tribe. "Tendit ad sidera
virtus&mdash;Paulo majora canamus&mdash;Secundum formam
statuti," &amp;c., and from time to time, when he is
greatly elated and wishes to show himself in all his
magnificence, he adopts the elegances and similes proper
to the euphuistic style: "The sparrow for his lecherie
liveth but a yeere," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Wilton is present first with the royal court of
England at the siege of Tournay, under Henry VIII.
What my credit was at this court "a number of my
creditors that I coosned can testifie." He lives on the
resources of his wits, playing tricks worthy a whipping
if not a hanging on respectable persons of limited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
capacity. His most notable victim is the purveyor of
drink or victualler to the camp, a tun-bellied coward,
proud of his pretended noble descent, a Falstaff grown
old, whose wit has been blunted, who has ended by marrying
Mistress Quickly, and has himself become tavern
keeper in partnership with her. In old days he drank
on credit: now the good fellows tipple at his expense.
Such is the end of all the Falstaffs and all the Scapins.
"This great Lorde, this worthie Lord," relates the
wicked page, "thought no scorne, Lord have mercy
upon us, to have his great velvet breeches larded with
the droppings of this dainty liquor," that is, the cider
that he sold; "and yet he was an olde servitor, a
cavelier of an ancient house, as it might appeare by the
armes of his ancestrie, drawen very amiably in chalk,
on the in side of his tent doore."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>The scene between the fat, ruddy host, open-mouthed,
blear-eyed, and the frolicking slender page,
who delights in his tricks and covers his victim with
jesting compliments, is extremely well described.
Wilton finds his man "counting his barrels, and
setting the price in chalke on the head of everie
one of them." He addresses him his "duty verie
devoutly," and tells him he has matters of some
secrecy to impart to him for which a private audience
is necessary:</p>

<p>"With me, young Wilton? quoth he, marie and
shalt. Bring us a pint of syder of a fresh tap into the
'Three Cups'<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> here; wash the pot!</p>

<p>"So into a backe roome he lead mee, where after hee
had spit on his finger, and picked off two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
moats of his olde moth eaten velvet cap, ... he badde
me declare my minde, and there upon he dranke to me
on the same."</p>

<p>Jack is careful not to touch at once on the matter in
his head: he knows his man and attacks him first by
that vanity of a noble descent which he possesses in
common with Falstaff. Jack has always borne him
affection, "partly for the high discent and linage from
whence he sprung, and partly for the tender care and
provident respect he had of poore soldiers ... he
vouchsafed in his own person to be a victualer to the
campe: a rare example of magnificence and courtesie;
and diligently provided, that without farre travel, every
man might have for his money syder and cheese his
bellyfull. Nor did he sell his cheese by the way onely,
or his syder by the great, but abast himselfe with his
owne hands to take a shoomakers knife: a homely
instrument for such a high personage to touch, and cut
it out equally like a true justiciarie in little penny-worthes
that it would doo a man good for to looke
upon. So likewise of his syder, the pore man might
have his moderate draught of it (as there is moderation
in all things) as well for his doit or his dandiprat as the
rich man for his halfe souse or his denier ..."</p>

<p>Jack goes on irrepressible, overflowing; it is his
best moment; he does not want the sport to end too
quickly: "Why, you are everie childs felow: any man
that comes under the name of a souldier and a good
fellowe, you will sitte and beare companie to the last
pot, yea, and you take in as good part the homely
phrase of: 'Mine host heeres to you,' as if one saluted
you by all the titles of your baronie. These considerations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>I saie, which the world suffers to slip by in the
channell of carelesnes, have moved me in ardent zeale
of your welfare, to forewarne you of some dangers that
have beset you and your barrels.</p>

<p>"At the name of dangers hee start up, and bounst
with his fist on the boord so hard, that his tapster
overhearing him cried: 'Anon! anon! sir,' and entering
with a bow askt him what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Hee was readie to have stricken his tapster for
interrupting him in attention of this his so much
desired relation, but for feare of displeasing me he
moderated his furie, and onely sending him for the
other fresh pint, wild him looke to the barre, and come
when he is cald with a devilles name.</p>

<p>"Well, at his earnest importunitie, after I had moistned
my lips, to make my lie run glib to his journies
end, forward I went as followeth ..." And the good
apostle stops again; the cider and his own words have
moved him; he is a little fuddled, so is mine host; they
both fall to weeping. The innkeeper is ready to believe
anything, and at this moment, which is the right one
the page at length determines to inform him that in an
assembly where he was present, he heard mine host,
the purveyor of the camp, accused of connivance with
the enemy, by giving information to the besieged
through letters hidden in his empty barrels. High
treason is suspected! How are these dangerous rumours
to be dissipated? There is only one way of doing it,
that is in becoming popular in the army, very popular;
he must make himself beloved by all; he must distribute
cider freely and for a time suppress in his shop
the unbecoming custom of paying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The victualler follows this advice, but soon the trick
is discovered; the page is roundly whipped, but being
to the core a true picaroon, Wilton does not for all that
feel his spirit in any way lessened: "Here let me
triumph a while, and ruminate a line or two on the
excellence of my wit!" This is all the sorrow and
repentance the whip extracts from him.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, two years later, fused the two characters
into one, caused the wit of the page to enter the brain
of the fat man, and the blending, animated by his
genius, produced the inimitable customer of the
"Boar's Head" tavern.</p>

<p>After various adventures, Wilton returns to London,
and struts about in fine clothes, whose originality he
describes with an amusing rush of language: "I had
my feather in my cap as big as a flag in the fore-top;
... my cape cloake of blacke cloth, over-spreading
my backe like a thornbacke or an elephantes eares,
... and in consummation of my curiositie my hands
without gloves, all a mode French." The sense of the
picturesque, the careful observation of the effect of a
pose, of a fold of a garment, were, before Nash, entirely
unknown to English novel writers, and it was not until
the eighteenth century, until the time of Defoe, Fielding,
and, above all, Sterne, that the author of "Jack
Wilton" was excelled in this special talent.</p>

<p>Soon the page takes up the course of his adventures
again, and travels anew on the continent. He visits
Venice, Florence, Rome, refraining with a care for
which he is to be thanked from trite descriptions.
What's the good of describing the monuments of
Rome? he says; everybody knows them: "he that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
hath but once drunke with a traveller, talkes of them."
Sir Thomas More contemplating his "Utopia," John
of Leyden dragged to the scaffold, the Earl of Surrey
jousting for the fair Geraldine "against all commers,"
Francis I., conqueror at Marignan, Erasmus, Aretino,
"one of the wittiest knaves that ever God made," and
other personages of the Renaissance, figure in the narrative.
Faithful to the picaresque plot, Nash conducts
his reader into all societies, from the tavern to the
palace, from the haunt of robbers to the papal court,
and makes his hero no better than he should be. At
Marignan, Wilton occupies himself especially in discovering
quickly who is likely to be the strongest, in
order to attach himself ardently to the winner. At
Venice he runs away with an Italian lady, deserts his
master, the Earl of Surrey, and passes himself off as
the Earl.</p>

<p>All this is too much at length for honest Nash, and
feeling not less displeased than ourselves with the wicked
actions of his hero, he himself interposes at times, not
without disadvantage to his plot, and, in spite of the
improbability of placing such remarks in Wilton's
mouth, introduces his own opinions on the persons and
incidents of the romance. This is an effect of the
impetuosity of his temperament, blameable undoubtedly
from an artistic point of view. We shall be indulgent
to him if we remember that no author of the time was
entirely master of himself and faithful to his plot.
Even Shakespeare rarely resists like temptation, and
when a poetic image comes into his mind, little matters
it to him what character is on the stage; he makes of
him a dreamer, a poet, and lends to him the exquisite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
language of his own emotion. Let us remember how
the murderers hired to assassinate Edward's children
describe the scene of the murder. They saw "the
gentle babes ... girdling one another</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within their alabaster innocent arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in their summer beauty, kiss'd each other."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very improbable remark, it will be admitted, on the
part of the murderers. But, then, it is Shakespeare
who talks aloud, forgetting that he is supposed not to
be there.</p>

<p>Nash, with like heedlessness, often interposes in his
own person, and takes the words out of his page's
mouth; and his bold, characteristic and concise
opinions are very curious in the history of manners
and literature. For example, when he describes the
war of the Anabaptists and the execution of John of
Leyden, he sums up thus in a short pithy sentence the
current opinion of his day among literary people and
men of the world, on the already formidable sect of
the Puritans: "Heare what it is to be Anabaptists,
to bee puritans, to be villaines: you may be counted
illuminate botchers for a while, but your end wil be:
Good people pray for me."</p>

<p>His open admiration of the charity of the Catholics
at Rome reveals in him great independence of mind and
much courage: "Yet this I must say to the shame of
us Protestants, if good workes may merit heaven they
doo them, we talke of them. Whether superstition or
no makes them unprofitable servants, that let pulpets
decide: but there, you shall have the bravest Ladies in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
gownes of beaten gold, washing pilgrimes and poore
souldiours feete, and dooing nothing they and their
wayting mayds all the yeare long, but making shirts
and bandes for them against they come by in distresse."</p>

<p>At Wittenberg, Wilton sees "Acolastus" performed,
an old play that was as popular in England as on the
continent,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and Nash's severe criticism on the actors
shows how well the difference between good comedians
and common players was understood in London. Nash
shared Shakespeare's opinion of the actors who "out-heroded
Herod," and he would have been of Moli&egrave;re's
way of thinking about the performances at the H&ocirc;tel de
Bourgogne: "One as if he had beene playning a clay
floore, stampingly troade the stage so harde with his
feete, that I thought verily he had resolved to doe the
carpenter that sette it uppe some utter shame. Another
floung his armes lyke cudgelles at a peare tree, insomuch
as it was mightily dreaded that hee woulde strike
the candles that hung above theyr heades out of their
sockets, and leave them all darke." This severe criticism
may serve to reassure us about the way in which
the great English dramas were interpreted at that
period.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> And indeed they deserved that some trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
should be taken with them, for in London it was
the time of "Romeo and Juliet," of "Midsummer
Night's Dream," of "Richard III."</p>

<p>In fact, Nash does not only possess the merit of
knowing how to observe the ridiculous side of human
nature, and of portraying in a full light picturesque
figures now worthy of Teniers and now of Callot;
some fat and greasy, others lean and lank; he possesses
a thing very rare with the picaresque school, the
faculty of being moved. He seems to have foreseen
the immense field of study which was to be opened
later to the novelist. A distant ancestor of Fielding,
as Lyly and Sidney appear to us to be distant ancestors
of Richardson, he understands that a picture of active
life, reproducing only, in the Spanish fashion, scenes of
comedy, is incomplete and departs from reality. The
greatest jesters, the most arrogant, the most venturesome
have their days of anguish; no brow has ever
remained unfurrowed from the cradle to the grave, and
no one has been able to live an impassive spectator and
not feel his heart sometimes beat the quicker, nor bow
his head in sorrow. Nash caught a glimpse of this,
and therefore mingled serious scenes with his pictures
of comedy, in order that his romance might the more
closely resemble life. Sometimes they are love scenes as
when the Earl of Surrey describes to us his awakening
passion for Geraldine, and how he met her at Hampton
Court: "Oh thrice emperiall Hampton Court, Cupids
inchaunted castle, the place where I first sawe <i>the perfect
omnipotence of the Almightie expressed in mortalitie</i>!"
Sometimes they are tragic scenes full of blood and tortures.
It is true that Nash then falls into melodrama<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and conducts his Wilton to a sort of Tour de Nesles
where the Countess Juliana, the Pope's mistress, gives
herself up to excesses, by the side of which those of Margaret
of Burgundy are but child's play. Murders, rapes,
and scenes of robbery multiply under cover of the plague
that rages at Rome, and the horrors resulting from the
pestilence are described with a vigour that reminds us
of Defoe, without however equalling him. Carts containing
the dead go up and down the streets, and
lugubrious cries resound: "Have you anie dead to
burie? Have you anie dead to burie?" The carts
"had manie times of one house their whole loading."</p>

<p>Wilton is accused of murders committed in his house;
the rope almost about his neck, he is saved by an
English earl, in exile, who seems to have been imbued
with Ascham's teaching, and who reproaches him for
travelling, especially in Italy, where morals are
so corrupt and where immorality is so dangerous.
"Take care," said the earl, "if thou doest but
lend halfe a looke to a Romans or Italians wife, thy
porredge shall bee prepared for thee, and cost thee
nothing but thy life." The earl, who proves to be a
rather pedantic nobleman, passes in review all nations,
and proves that they are not worth the trouble of going
to see. Wilton, whose personal experience does not justify
such unfavourable prognostications, especially now that
he is out of danger, is wearied by this talk, and, pretending
important business, gives his chattering benefactor
the slip. He is soon punished; he is captured by the
Jews of Rome; his adventures become more and more
mysterious and alarming, and more and more does
melodrama invade the story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, however, in the midst of these abominations,
Nash's tone rises; his language becomes eloquent
and his emotion infectious; he shudders himself, horror
penetrates him and seizes us; the jests of the picaroon
are very far from our mind, the drama is then as terrible
as with the most passionate romanticists of our century
in their best moments.</p>

<p>Few stories of our day are better contrived to give
the sense of the horrible than the story of the vengeance
of Cutwolfe related by himself just as he is going to be
tortured. After a prolonged search, Cutwolfe at last
finds his enemy, Esdras of Granada, alone, in his shirt,
and far from all help. The unfortunate man implores
Cutwolfe, whose brother he had killed, to make it
impossible for him to do any more harm, to mutilate
him, but to spare his life. His enemy replies:
"Though I knewe God would never have mercie on
mee except I had mercie on thee, yet of thee no mercie
would I have.... I tell thee, I would not have undertooke
so much toyle to gaine heaven, as I have done
in pursuing thee for revenge. Divine revenge, of
which, as one of the joies above, there is no fulnes or
satietie. Looke how my feete are blistered with following
thee from place to place. I have riven my throat
with overstraining it to curse thee. I have ground my
teeth to powder with grating and grinding them
together for anger, when anie hath nam'd thee. My
tongue with vaine threates is bolne, and waxen too big
for my mouth.... Entreate not, a miracle maye not
reprive thee."</p>

<p>The scene is prolonged. Esdras continues to beg
for his life; he will become the slave, the chattel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
his enemy. An idea comes into the mind of the latter:
Sell thy soul to the devil, and I will pardon thee.
Esdras immediately utters horrible blasphemies.</p>

<p>"My joints trembled and quakt," continues Cutwolfe,
"with attending them, my haire stood upright,
and my hart was turned wholly to fire.... The veyne
in his left hand that is derived from his heart with no
faint blow he pierst, and with the bloud that flowd from
it, writ a ful obligation of his soule to the divell: yea
more earnestly he praied unto God never to forgive
his soule than manie Christians doo to save theyr
soules. These fearfull ceremonies brought to an end,
I bad him ope his mouth and gape wide. He did so:
as what wil not slaves doo for feare? Therwith made
I no more adoo, but shot him ful into the throat with
my pistol: no more spake he after; so did I shoote
him that hee might never speak after, or repent him.
His body being dead lookd as black as a toad."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>This conversation and the sight of Cutwolfe's
horrible punishment, recall Jack Wilton to himself.
He regrets his irregular life, but not to the point of
refunding the money stolen from the Countess Juliana;
rich as Gil Bias, he can now, like him, take rank
among peaceable and settled folk; he marries his
Venetian lady, and returns to the king of England's
army, occupied in giving a grand reception to Francis I.
at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. There ends the
most complete career furnished in England, before
Defoe, by a character of fiction.</p>

<p>The primary if not only result of the publication of
"Jack Wilton" was, so far as the author himself was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
concerned, to place him in new difficulties. His well-known
satirical vein, his constant use and abuse of
allusions, which often render him obscure, were so well
known that it was considered improbable that he had
been writing this time with a merely artistic aim. He
had been careful to state in his dedication that readers
would merely find in his book "some reasonable conveyance
of historie and varietie of mirth," and that he
was attempting a kind of writing new to him; it was
to no purpose. Readers were on the look-out for
allusions; they took his historical heroes for living
people but thinly disguised, and lined Nash's story with
another of their own invention. The author, who well
knew the dangers of such interpretations, never ceased
to protest that, in this work at least, there was no
place for them. When once the public is started upon
such a track, it is no easy matter to make them turn
round. Nash had recourse to his usual revenge, that
is, to laugh at his interpreters. "I am informed," he
wrote, shortly after his "Wilton" was printed, "there
be certaine busie wits abrode that seeke to anagrammatize
the name of Wittenberge to one of the Universities
of England; that scorn to be counted honest,
plaine meaning men, like their neighbours, for not so
much as out of mutton and potage, but they will
construe a meaning of kings and princes. Let one but
name bread, but they will interpret it to be the town
of Bredan in the Low countreyes; if of beere he talkes,
then straight he mockes the countie Beroune in France;
if of foule weather or a shower of raine, he hath relation
to some that shall raigne next."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>His remonstrances seem to have had very indifferent
success, and Nash, to our great loss, did not again
attempt novel writing. But the vein was in him,
and it constantly reappears in the variety of pamphlets
he has left behind him. Fine scenes of comedy, good
portraits of ridiculous characters to be met in every-day
life, amusing anecdotes, nearly all the elements of a
sound comic novel are scattered through his writings.
The familiar portraits of the upstart, of the false politician,
of the inventor of new sects, portraits at which
many observers of human nature in the time of Shakespeare
tried their hand, are to be seen in the gallery
Nash painted in his "Pierce Penilesse."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Conformably
to the fitness of things, Nash described himself under
the name of Pierce,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> as Sidney had given his high moral
tone, his melancholy and loving soul to the shepherd
Philisides, as Greene had told his own miseries under
the name of poor Roberto. Here is Nash's portrait of
the upstart who has travelled abroad and has brought
back from his journey nothing more valuable than scorn
for his own country: "Hee will bee humorous forsooth
and have a broode of fashions by himselfe. Somtimes,
because Love commonly wears the liverie of wit, hee will
be an <i>Inamorato poeta</i>, and sonnet a whole quire of paper
in praise of Ladie Manibetter, his yeolowfac'd mistres....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
All <i>Italionato</i> is his talke, and his spade peake [<i>i.e.</i>, his
beard] is as sharpe as if he had been a pioner before
the walls of Roan. Hee will dispise the barbarisme of
his owne countrey, and tell a whole legend of lyes of
his travayles unto Constantinople. If he be challenged
to fight ... hee objects that it is not the custome
of the Spaniard or the Germaine to looke backe to
everie dog that barks. You shall see a dapper Jacke
that hath beene but once at Deepe, wring his face
round about, as a man would stirre up a mustard pot
and talke English through the teeth, like Jaques Scabdhams,
or Monsieur Mingo de Moustrapo; when, poore
slave, he hath but dipt his bread in wylde boares greace
and come home againe, or been bitten by the shinnes by
a wolfe; and saith he hath adventured uppon barricadoes
of Gurney or Guingan, and fought with the yong
Guise hand to hand."</p>

<p>Like Ben Jonson, Nash met on his way some Politick
Would-Bes that "thinke to be counted rare politicians
and statesmen, by beeing solitarie: as who should say,
I am a wise man,"<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>&mdash;"and when I ope my lips," would
have added Shakespeare, "let no dog bark!" He
has met inventors of sects, and has heard of pre-Darwinian
"mathematicians" who doubt the fact that
there were no men before Adam and are inclined to
think there are no devils at all. Nash strongly condemns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>these inventors and mathematicians, drawing at
the same time a curious picture of the state of confusion
in religious matters which was then so conspicuous in
England: "They will set their self love to study to
invent new sects of singularitie, thinking to live when
they are dead, by having their sect called after their
names: as Donatists of Donatus, Arrian[s] of Arrius,
and a number more of new faith founders, that have
made England the exchange of innovations and almost
as much confusion of religion in everie quarter, as there
was of tongues at the building of the Tower of Babel ...</p>

<p>"Hence atheists triumph and rejoyce and talke as
prophanely of the Bible as of Bevis of Hampton.
I heare say there are mathematicians abroad that will
proove men before Adam; and they are harboured in
high places, who will maintayne to the death that there
are no divells."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Scenes of light comedy abound in Nash; they are
especially numerous in his "Lenten Stuff,"<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> a queer
little book, his last work, and one which he seems to
have written <i>con amore</i>. Never was he in better
humour than when, the year before his death, he betook
himself to singing "the praise of the red herring,"
Monsieur Herring, Solyman Herring, Sacrapant Herring,
Red Herring of Red Herring hall, Pater Patri&aelig;,
as he is fond of calling him, inventing on each page a
new title for his hero. There is no event in ancient
or modern history where he does not discover that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
"C&aelig;sarean Charlemaine Herring" has had a part to
play; no person of however mean or exalted rank who
has not had to deal with "Gentleman Jacke Herring."
The fishes made him their king, and the Pope made
him a saint. The first time he appeared at the Pope's
court was a great event in Christendom. An English
sailor had sold him for three hundred ducats to the
purveyor of the papal kitchen, and "delivered him the
king of fishes, teaching hym to geremumble it, sauce
it, and dresse it, and so sent him away a glad man.
All the Pope's cookes in their white sleeves and linnen
aprons met him middle way to entertaine and receyve
the king of fishes, and together by the eares they went,
who shoulde first handle him or touch him. But the
clarke of the kitchin appeased that strife, and would
admit none but him selfe to have the scorching and
carbonadoing of it, and he kissed his hands thrice,
and made as many <i>humblessos</i> before he woulde finger
it; and, such obeysances performed, he drest it as he
was enjoyned, kneeling on his knes, and mumbling
twenty <i>Ave Maryes</i> to hymselfe, in the sacrifizing of
it on the coales, that his diligent service in the broyling
and combustion of it, both to his kingship and to his
fatherhood might not seeme unmeritorious."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>However careful Thomas Nash had been to act
according to the views attributed to Dr. Andrew Borde
concerning the cultivation of mirth as a preservative
of health, he reached what this authority calls "the
mirth of heaven," with much more rapidity than might
have been expected. His mirth diet was obviously
adulterated and mingled with wrath and sorrow. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
had been born in 1567, and we read about him in a
comedy performed at Cambridge in 1601, these verses
which are friendly if not very poetical:</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>The manner in which his friend Dekker represents
him, shortly after, reaching the Elysian fields, leaves
little doubt that his life was shortened not only by his
angry passions, but by sheer want: "Marlow, Greene and
Peele had got under the shades of a large vyne, laughing
to see Nash, that was but newly come to their colledge,
still haunted with the sharpe and satyricall spirit that
followed him heere upon earthe: for Nash inveyed
bitterly, as he had wont to do against dryfisted patrons,
accusing them of his untimely death, because if they
had given his Muse that cherishment which she most
worthily deserved, hee had fed to his dying day on fat
capons, burnt sack and sugar, and not so desperately
have venturde his life and shortned his dayes by
keeping company with pickle herrings."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Some of Shakespeare's contemporaries attempted to
give their readers "the like" of Nash's wit, and tried
their hand either at the picaresque novel or at the
reproduction of scenes taken from ordinary life, of
which Greene also had left some examples. The comic
school was far from equalling the fecundity of its
romantic rival; it existed however, and though absolutely
forgotten now, it helped to keep up and improve
the natural gift of observation which belonged to
the English race.</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary ventures ever attempted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>in the picaresque style was made by Henry
Chettle, another member of the group to which Greene,
Nash, and the others belonged. He was, like Nash
himself, a personal friend of Greene, and published after
his death his "Groats-worth of wit," 1592, for which,
as we have seen, he had to offer in his next pamphlet
explanations and apologies, among others, to Shakespeare.
Chettle seems to have followed the literary
career usual in his time; he composed many dramas
alone<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> or in collaboration; he was perpetually borrowing
money from the notorious Henslowe, and he was
occasionally lodged in Her Majesty's prisons. In 1595
he published his "Piers Plainnes seaven yeres prentiship,"<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
in which we find, mingled together, Sidney's
Arcady, Greene's romantic heroes, and the customary
incidents of picaresque novels. The scene is laid in
Tempe; there are Menalcas and Corydons; there are
sheep who are poetically invited by their keeper to eat
their grass:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sport on faire flocke at pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nip Vestaes flouring treasure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is too Piers Plain, now a shepherd but
formerly nothing short of a picaro, who has seen much
and has followed many trades, and served many masters.
His companions asked for his story, and he very
willingly agreed to tell them what he had been, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
what the world is," no mean subject to be sure, and
no wonder that he "cravde pardon to sit because the
taske was long, which they willingly graunted." Piers,
according to the picaresque traditions, had been the
servant of many masters; he tells his experience of them
in the first person, following also in this the rules of the
picaresque tale. He first introduces us to a swaggering
and cowardly courtier, and plays his part in intrigues
and conspiracies. Then he describes the "vertuous
and famous virgin &AElig;liana," Queen of Crete, who
delighted in hunting, and went to the woods "Diana-like."
To be "Diana-like," she dressed as follows:</p>

<p>"On her head she wore a coronet of orientall pearle;
on it a chaplet of variable flowers perfuming the ayre
with their divers odors, thence carelessly descended
her amber coloured hair ... Her buskins were
richly wrought like the Delphins spangled cabazines;
her quiver was of unicornes horne, her darts of yvorie;
in one hand she helde a boare speare, the other guided
her Barbary jennet, proud by nature, but nowe more
proude in that he carried natures fairest worke, the
Easterne worlds chiefe wonder." In a somewhat similar
style Zucchero painted the Queen, not of Crete, but
of England, and when dressed in this fashion, Her
Majesty too, was supposed to be represented "Diana-like."</p>

<p>Of the misrule in Crete, and of the dangers &AElig;liana
runs from the incestuous passions of her uncle, and
of her escape through the providential intervention
of Prince &AElig;milius, we shall say nothing; nor of the
"frolicke common-wealth" established in Thrace, feeling
as we do some sympathy with Corydon, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
interrupts the speaker, saying: "Reach hither thy
bottle that we may drinke round; I am sure thou
must needes be dry with talking when I am so a thirst
with hearing." Piers passes from the court to the
shop of a dealer in old clothes and an usurer. He
leads a very miserable life, and we have sordid descriptions
of scenes in low life with which Chettle
was better acquainted than with the loves of &AElig;milius
and &AElig;liana. Princes and princesses come in again;
there are revolutions, awful dangers and marvellous
deliverances. All ends happily, and Piers and his
hearers agree to meet "at theyr ploughman's holidaye.
Where what happened, if Piers Plainnes please, shall
per adventure be published." This "adventure"
never took place. The incoherent mixture of the
picaresque, romantic, and Arcadian tale resulted in
such an unpalatable compound that even novel-readers
of Shakespeare's time objected to a narration of this
kind, and did not trouble Chettle with a demand for its
continuation.</p>

<p>His reputation therefore rests mainly on his dramas.
One of his most frequent associates in writing them,
and one of the most prolific and gifted, Thomas
Dekker, was also something of a novelist. He has
left, besides a great quantity of plays, a number of
pamphlets written very much in Nash's vein,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> in which
there is some excellent realism, together with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
most amusing and whimsical fancies.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> His biography
is a mere repetition of his friend's life, and the words:
Henslowe, drama, penury, pamphlets, prison, quarrels,
put together, will give a sufficient idea of the sort of
existence led by him as well as by so many of his
associates.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> He wrote some of his plays alone, many
others with numberless collaborators, such as Chettle,
Drayton, Wilson, Ben Jonson (with whom he afterwards
had a violent quarrel), Haughton, Day, Munday,
Hathaway, Middleton, Webster, Heywood, Wentworth
Smith, Massinger, Ford, Rowley, and even others, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the dramatic faculty was then so very common that
any one, so to say, was good enough to act as a
collaborator in writing plays.</p>

<p>He had many traits in common with Nash: the
same excellent faculty of observation, the same gaiety
and <i>entrain</i>, with powers of his own to associate it
with the most exquisite tenderness and pathos; the
same love for literature and for the poets, for Chaucer,
for Spenser, whose arrival in the Elysian fields he
describes in a way to tempt the pencil of a painter:
"Grave Spenser was no sooner entred into this
chappell of Apollo, but these elder fathers of the
divine furie gave him a lawrer and sung his welcome;
Chaucer call'd him his sonne and plac'd him at his
right hand. All of them, at a signe given by the
whole quire of the Muses that brought him thither,
closing up their lippes in silence, and turning all their
eares for attention to heare him sing out the rest of
Fayrie Queenes prayses."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>But a marked difference between Dekker and Nash
resulted from the fact that Dekker had not only a love
of poetry, but a poetical faculty of a high order. He
went far beyond the picturesqueness of Nash's word-painting,
and reached in his prose as well as in his
verse true lyrical emotion and pathos; he had, said
Lamb, "poetry enough for anything;"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Nash's gaiety, true and hearty as it is, takes often and
naturally a bitter satirical turn, Dekker's gaiety though
sometimes bitter, more usually takes a pretty, graceful,
and fanciful turn. "Come, strew apace, strew, strew:
in good troth tis a pitty that these flowers must be
trodden under feete as they are like to be anon ...</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/img45.jpg" width="391" height="400" alt="&quot;dekker his dream.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;dekker his dream.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Pitty? come foole, fling them about lustily;
flowers never dye a sweeter death than when they are
smoother'd to death in a Lovers bosome, or else pave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the high wayes over which these pretty, simpering,
setting things call'd brides must trippe."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Intimate literary ties, however, existed between Nash
and Dekker; many passages in the one remind us of
similar things in the other, the result sometimes of
actual imitation, sometimes of involuntary reminiscences.
Dekker was well aware of the family likeness
between the two, so much so that we see him once calling
Nash's ghost to his assistance, as one from whom
he might most naturally gain help: "And thou into
whose soule ... the raptures of that fierie and inconfinable
Italian spirit were bounteously and boundlesly
infused; thou sometimes secretary to Pierce Pennylesse
and master of his requests, ingenious, ingenuous, fluent,
facetious T. Nash, from whose aboundant pen hony
flow'd to thy friends, and mortall aconite to thy
enemies; thou that madest the doctor a flat dunce<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
... sharpest satyre, luculent poet, elegant orator, get
leave for thy ghost to come from her abiding and
to dwell with me awhile."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Nash's ghost was most certainly hovering about
Dekker when he was writing the pamphlet from which
this apostrophe is taken; it taught him how to disrobe
for our amusement the heroes of antique legends of
their dignified looks and dresses, and place their haloed
selves in the open daylight of the street below our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
window. With all his admiration for Marlowe's
performance Nash had told, in very ludicrous fashion
indeed, the story of Hero and Leander, associating in
a manner unwarranted by ancient historians their fate
with the vicissitudes of Great Yarmouth and the red
herring. In the same way Dekker makes choice of
that exquisite tale of Orpheus which reads so pathetically
in the prose of King Alfred, and he tells it thus:</p>

<p>"Assist mee therefore, thou genius of that ventrous
but zealous musicion of Thrace, Euridice's husband,
who being besotted on his wife, of whiche sin none
but ... should be guiltie, went alive with his fiddle
at's backe, to see if he could bail her out of that
adamantine prison. The fees he was to pay for her
were jigs and countrey-daunces: he paid them; the
forfeits if he put on yellow stockings and lookt back
upon her, was her everlasting lying there, without
bayle or mayne-prize. The loving coxcomb could not
choose but look backe, and so lost her: perhaps hee did
it because he would be rid of her. The morall of
which is, that if a man leave his owne busines and
have an eie to his wives dooings, sheele give him the
slip though she runne to the divell for her labour."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Dekker did not write novels properly so called, but
his prose works abound with scenes that seem detached
from novels, and that were so well fitted for that kind
of writing that we find them again in the works of
professional novelists of his or of a later time. His
"Wonderfull yeare 1603," from which Defoe seems
to have taken several hints, abounds in scenes of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
sort.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> It is a book "wherein is shewed the picture
of London lying sicke of the plague. At the ende
of all, like a mery epilogue to a dull play sundry
tales are cut out in sundry fashions of purpose to
shorten the lives of long winters nights that lye
watching in the darke for us." Some of these tales
are extremely well told, for Dekker is more successful
in describing the humours than the terrors of the
plague. In one of them we find another copy of the
fat hostler so well described already by Nash and, as
it seems, inspired by a reminiscence of the picture in
"Jack Wilton." Dekker's man is not thinner, cleaner,
nor braver than Nash's victualler. He is a country
innkeeper: "a goodly fat burger he was, with a belly
arching out like a beere-barrell, which made his legges,
that were thicke and short like two piles driven under
London bridge.... In some corners of [his nose]
there were blewish holes that shone like shelles of
mother of pearle ... other were richly garnisht with
rubies, chrisolites, and carbunckles, which glistered so
oriently, that the Hamburgers offered I know not
how many dollars for his companie in an East-Indian
voyage, to have stoode a nightes in the poope of their
Admirall, onely to save the charge of candles.</p>

<p>"In conclusion he was an host to be ledde before
an Emperour, and though he were one of the greatest
men in all the shire, his bignes made him not proude,
but he humbled himself to speake the base language
of a tapster, and uppon the Londoners first arrival,
cried: 'Welcome! a cloth for this gentleman!' The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
linnen was spread and furnisht presently with a new
cake and a can, the roome voided, and the guest left,
like a French Lord, attended by no bodie."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>This new-comer, freshly arrived from London was
flying on account of the plague; but it so happened
that he had himself already contracted the disease;
he was scarcely seated before it grew upon him and
he fell dead. Great was the terror in the inn. The
host, the maids, all the inmates ran from the corpse
and left the house; the terror spread in the borough;
no one would even walk near the place.</p>

<p>"At last a tinker came sounding through the towne,
mine hosts being the auncient watring place where he
did use to cast anchor. You must understand he was
none of those base rascally tinkers that with a bandog
and a drab at their tayles and a picke staffe at their
necks will take a purse sooner then stop a kettle. No
this was a devout tinker, he did honor God Pan; a
musicall tinker, that upon his kettle-drum could play
any countrey-dance you cald for, and upon Holly-dayes
had earned money by it, when no fidler could be heard
of. Hee was onely feared when he stalkt through
some towns where bees were, for he strucke so sweetely
on the bottome of his copper instrument that he would
emptie whole hives and leade the swarmes after him,
only by the sound."</p>

<p>These two beings, the host and tinker, depicted as
vividly by Dekker as Callot would have drawn them,
meet in the open air, and the former offers the tinker
a crown if he undertakes to bury the dead man. The
tinker haggles for better payment and they agree for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ten shillings. "The whole parish had warning of this
presently ... therefore ten shillings were leveyed
out of hand, put into a rag, which was tyed to the
ende of a long pole and delivered, in sight of all the
parish, who stood aloofe stopping their noses, by
the head boroughs owne selfe in proper person."
Nothing dismayed by this awful array, the tinker sits
at table, drinks deep, takes the corpse on his back
and carries it to a field. Before committing it to the
earth he carefully searches its pockets and empties
them; he then makes a parcel of the clothes "and
carrying that at the end of his staffe on his shoulder,
with the purse of seven pounds in his hand, backe
againe comes he through the towne, crying aloud:
'Have you any more Londoners to bury; Hey downe
a downe dery; Have you any more Londoners to
bury?' The Hobbinolls running away from him as if
he had beene the dead citizens ghost, and he marching
away from them in all the hast he could, with that
song still in his mouth."</p>

<p>Another sort of writing congenial to Dekker's
temperament, and which novelists of a later date continued
to cultivate after him, are those series of
counsels or praises in which, with due seriousness, the
thing is recommended or praised which ought to be
avoided. An example of this kind of satirical composition
is the famous "Quinze joyes de mariage,"
in which the pleasant humours of a young wife are
described in such a way as to deter even a Panurge
from marrying. Another example is the "Grobianus"<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Latin poem of the German F. Dedekind, which enjoyed
an immense reputation throughout Europe in the sixteenth
century; it contains ironical advice to a gallant
with regard to his behaviour so that in any given
circumstances he may be as objectionable and improper
as possible.</p>

<p>Dekker translated both works into English, but
with many alterations, so numerous indeed, especially
in the last, that his book may be considered almost
original.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> He called it "The Guls Horne-booke," or
alphabet. He gives in it a lively description of the
humours of gallants in the time of Shakespeare, of the
places they used to frequent, and the company they
liked to meet. Grobianism differs from the picaresque
tale by the absence of a story connecting the various
scenes, but it resembles it in the opportunity it affords
for describing a variety of characters, humours, and
places. In the same way as we follow the picaro in
the houses of his several masters, we here follow the
gallant from his rooms to his ordinary, and from St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Paul's to the play. We climb with him to the top of
the cathedral, we show our new garments in the walks,
meet courtiers, soldiers and poets at dinner, stroll at
night in the dark streets of the city and fall in with
the watch. Here, again, Dekker paints from life scenes
with which he was familiar, and we have but to follow
his footsteps to become acquainted with the haunts of
the Bohemians of his time, and of the great men too,
of Jonson and Shakespeare themselves.</p>

<p>The scene at the theatre is the most original and
lively of all. The serio-comic advice to the gallant
how he "should behave himself in a playhouse"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> is a
perfect picture of what was daily taking place, be the
play Shakespeare's "Hamlet" or Dekker's "Patient
Grissil."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Of course the gallant must sit on the
stage and "on the very rushes," which in the theatre,
and also in palaces and houses, continued as in the
Middle Ages to serve for carpets;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> he will not care for
the disapprobation of the groundlings, but must plant
himself valiantly, "beating downe the mewes and hisses
of opposed rascality.</p>

<p>"For do but cast up a reckoning; what large
commings-in are pursd up by sitting on the stage?
First a conspicuous eminence is gotten; by which
meanes, the best and most essencial parts of a
gallant (good cloathes, a proportionable legge, white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
hand, the Persian lock, and a tollerable beard), are
perfectly revealed."</p>

<p>Of course you must choose with the greatest care
your time to come in. "Present not your selfe on
the stage especially at a new play until the quaking
Prologue hath, by rubbing, got [colour] into his
cheekes and is ready to give the trumpets their cue
that hees upon point to enter; for then it is time, as
though you were one of the properties, or that you
dropt out of ye hangings, to creepe from behind the
arras, with your tripos or three-footed stoole in one
hand and a teston (<i>i.e.</i>, six pence) mounted betweene
a forefinger and a thumbe in the other; for if you
should bestow your person upon the vulgar when the
belly of the house is but halfe full, your apparell is
quite eaten up, the fashion lost ..."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>When the play is well begun, there is also a special
behaviour to observe: "It shall crowne you with rich
commendation to laugh alowd in the middest of the
most serious and saddest scene of the terriblest tragedy;
and to let that clapper your tongue, be tost so high
that all the house may ring of it: your lords use it;
your knights are apes to the lords, and do so too ...
be thou a beagle to them all.... [At] first, all the
eyes in the galleries will leave walking after the players
and onely follow you; the simplest dolt in the house
snatches up your name, and when he meetes you in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the streetes, ... heele cry: 'hees such a gallant.' ...
Secondly you publish your temperance to the world,
in that you seeme not to resort thither to taste vaine
pleasures with a hungrie appetite; but only as a
gentleman to spend a foolish houre or two, because
you can doe nothing else; thirdly you mightily dis relish
the audience and disgrace the author." Perhaps
the next time he will be wise enough to offer you a
dedication sonnet "onely to stop your mouth."</p>

<p>The getting away must not be less carefully
performed than the getting in. If you owe the
author a particular grudge, mind you leave just in
the middle of his play: "bee it Pastoral or Comedy,
Morall or Tragedie, you rise with a screwd and
discontented face from your stoole to be gone: no
matter whether the scenes be good or no; the better
they are, the worse you distast them. And being on
your feet, sneake not away like a coward; but salute
all your gentle acquaintance, that are spred either on
the rushes or on stooles about you; and draw what
troope you can from the stage after you. The
mimicks are beholden to you for allowing them
elbow roome; their poet cries perhaps, 'A pox go
with you'; but care not for that; there is no musick
without frets."</p>

<p>But the rain outside may deprive you of the benefits
of this carefully laid plan. In that case, and this is the
last piece of advice, here is what you must do: "If
either the company or indisposition of the weather binde
you to sit it out, my counsell is then that you turne
plain ape: take up a rush, and tickle the earnest eares
of your fellow gallants to make other fooles fall a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
laughing; mewe at passionate speeches; blare at merrie;
find fault with the musicke; whew at the children's
action, whistle at the songs."</p>

<p>Dekker knew only too well such gallants as those
he describes, and if his picture of a theatre in
Shakespeare's time seems now somewhat exaggerated,
if we cannot conceive "Hamlet" or "Romeo"
performed while gallants on the stage tickle each
other's ears with rushes picked from the stage boards,
let us remember as a confirmation of his accuracy that
such customs were prevalent, not only in England, but
in Europe. In France especially, even in the time of
the Grand Roi, when Moli&egrave;re and Corneille were
shining in all their glory, we have Moli&egrave;re's corroborating
evidence that these customs had not been
abolished. Moli&egrave;re was annoyed by the same malpractices
as Shakespeare, only he did not, like
Shakespeare, who never complained of anything or
anybody, keep his displeasure to himself. He recurs
in more than one of his plays to the indecent behaviour
of marquesses sitting on the stage, and there is scarcely
one of the particulars mentioned by Dekker which
does not find place in Moli&egrave;re's angry pictures of
ill-bred gallants:</p>

<p>"The actors began; every one kept silence; when
... a man with large rolls entered abruptly crying
out: 'Hulloa, there, a seat directly!' and disturbing
the audience with his uproar, interrupted the play in
its finest passage....</p>

<p>"Whilst I was shrugging my shoulders, the actors
attempted to continue their parts. But the man made
a fresh disturbance in seating himself, and again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
crossing the stage with long strides, although he might
have been quite comfortable at the wings, he planted
his chair full in front, and, defying the audience with
his broad back, hid the actors from three-fourths of
the pit.</p>

<p>"A murmur arose, at which any one else would have
felt ashamed; but he, firm and resolute, took no
notice of it, and would have remained just as he had
placed himself if, to my misfortune, he had not cast his
eyes on me....</p>

<p>"He began asking me a hundred frivolous questions,
raising his voice higher than the actors. Every one
was cursing him; and in order to check him, I said,
'I should like to listen to the play.'</p>

<p>"'Hast thou not seen it, marquis? Oh! on my
soul I think it very funny, and I am no fool in those
matters. I know the canons of perfection and Corneille
reads me all that he writes.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon he gave me a summary of the piece
informing me, scene after scene, of what was about
to happen; and when we came to any lines which he
knew by heart, he recited them aloud before the actor
could say them. It was in vain for me to resist; he
continued his recitations, and towards the end rose a
good while before the rest. For those fashionable
fellows, in order to behave gallantly, especially avoid
to listen to the conclusion."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Grobianism and the picaresque novel, long survived
both Nash and Dekker. English, Spanish, and
French rogues, invented or imitated, swarmed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
English literature of the seventeenth century, without,
however, in any case reaching the level attained
by "Jack Wilton." Both kinds of writing had to
wait for the time of Swift and Defoe to reach their
highest point. Defoe has left the best examples of the
picaresque tale extant in English literature, and Swift
revived Grobianism with unparalleled excellence in his
"Directions to Servants" and his "Complete Collection
of genteel and ingenious conversation, according
to the most polite mode and method now used at court
and in the best companies of England."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>As for the "Quinze joyes," turned also into English
by Dekker, its popularity was equally great in England;
a new and different translation was published
in the seventeenth century and had several editions.
It was prefaced with a note "to the Reader," in which
the satirical aims of the author in this study of woman's
foibles is accentuated by a tone of pretended praise,
savouring of Grobianism and anticipating the sort of
ridicule which was to be relished by Pope and the
critics of Queen Anne's time. "This treatise ... will
at least shake, if not totally explode, that common
opinion, viz., that women are the worst piece of the
Hexameron creation.... This is the composition of
some amorous person, who, animated with the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
spirit and affection as I am, hath undertaken, and
judged it his duty too, to satisfie you, and he hopes so
far as to work upon you a persuasion that the modesty,
bashfulness, debonairet&eacute; and civility, together with all
qualifications that adorn and beautifie the soul, are as
exemplarily eminent in women of this age as ever they
were in any of the former; and instruct you to set a
value on their actions as the best creatures in the worst
of times, whose vertue must needs shine with the
greater lustre, being subject to the vain assaults and
ineffectual temptations of men grown old, like the
times, in wickednes, malice and revenge."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

were current in Europe during the Middle Ages, and which the
success of Eulenspiegel again put into circulation. The very
coarse anecdote connected with the death of Til (chap. xcii.) is
the subject of Chaucer's Sompnoures tale. The story in chapter
lxxx. of the innkeeper who asks payment for the smell of his
dishes, and who is paid with a tinkling of coins, is also very old,
and was afterwards made use of by Rabelais. "Til" was very
popular in France and in England. It was translated in both
countries; in the latter one, under the title: "Here beginneth a

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>AFTER SHAKESPEARE.</h3>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In the works of Nash and his imitators, the different
parts are badly dovetailed; the novelist is incoherent
and incomplete; the fault lies in some
degree with the picaresque form itself. Nash, however,
pointed out the right road, the road that was to
lead to the true novel. He was the first among his
compatriots to endeavour to relate in prose a long-sustained
story, having for its chief concern: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
truth. He leaves to his real heroes, Surrey, More,
Erasmus, Aretino, their historical character, and he
gives to his fictitious ones caprices and qualities
which make of them distinct and living beings like
those of every-day life. He gives us no more languid
shepherds, no more romantic disguises, no more pretended
warriors whose helmets cover, as in Ariosto,
a woman's fair locks. His style is flexible, animated,
suited to the circumstances, free from those ornaments
of language so sought after in his time; no one,
Ben Jonson excepted, possessed at that epoch, in so
great a degree as himself, a love of the honest truth.
With Nash, then, the novel of real life, whose invention
in England is generally attributed to Defoe, begins.
To connect Defoe with the past of English literature,
we must get over the whole of the seventeenth century
and go back to "Jack Wilton," the worthy brother of
"Roxana," "Moll Flanders," and "Colonel Jack."</p>

<p>But shepherds were not yet silenced, nor had
romantic heroes spoken their last. On the contrary,
their best time was still to come; in the
seventeenth century they resumed their hardly interrupted
speeches, conversations, correspondence, exploits
and adventures, and flourished mightily in the world.
We come to the time of the heroic romance and
heroic drama. The main originality of the romance
literature in England during this century was the
increase and over-refinement of heroism in works of
fiction. For many among the reading public of that
age, Shakespeare was barbarous and Racine tame;
but Scud&eacute;ry was the "greatest wit" that ever lived.</p>

<p>This kind of writing was thus partially renovated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
through certain superadded characteristics, the part
allotted to "heroism" being the foremost; but the
groundwork was as old as the very origin of the nation.
For this new species of novel was mainly a development
of the old chivalrous romances of early and medi&aelig;val
times. These romances, as we know, had continued in
Elizabethan times to enjoy some reputation, and under
an altered shape to have a public of their own. Even
in the seventeenth century they had not passed entirely
out of sight. Palmerins, Dons Belianis and Esplandians
continued to be written, translated, adapted, paraphrased,
printed, purchased, and read. There was still
a brisk trade in this sort of literature. People continued
to read "the auncient, famous and honourable
history of Amadis de Gaule, discoursing the adventures
loves and fortunes of many princes;"<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> or again "the
famous history of Hercules of Greece, with the manner
of his encountering and overcoming serpents, lyons,
monsters, giants, tyrants and powerful armies."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Guy
of Warwick, our friend of former chapters, still carried
on, with undaunted energy, his manifold exploits
throughout the world. Only, as time passes, we find
that he has become civilized; he has taken trouble
to improve his mind, he has read books; he has even
gone to the play. And his choice shows him a man
of taste and feeling; a man with a memory too; for
reaching a cemetery somewhere in his travels he "took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
up a worm-eaten skull, which he thus addressed:
Perhaps thou wert a prince or a mighty monarch, a
King, a Duke or a Lord. But the King and the
beggar must all return to the earth; and therefore
man hath need to remember his dying hour. Perhaps
thou mightest have been a Queen or a Dutchess, or a
Lady varnished with much beauty; but now thou art
worms meat, lying in the grave, the sepolchre of all
creatures." We are only surprised that "Alas poor
Yorick" does not come in. The page is beautifully
adorned with an engraving representing Sir Guy in
cocked hat, addressing a skull he carries in his hand.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<span class="caption">sir guy of warwick addressing a skull.</span>
</div>

<p>The same phenomenon was taking place in France,
and from France were to come the first examples of
the regular heroic romance. "I have read [Lancelot]"
says Sarasin, in a conversation reported by the well-known
Jean Chapelain, the author of "La Pucelle,"
and "I have not found it too unpleasant. Among the
things that have pleased me in it I found that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the source of all the romances which for four or five
centuries have been the noblest entertainment of all
the courts of Europe and have prevented barbarism
from encompassing the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> But as well
as Guy of Warwick, Lancelot wanted some "rajeunissement."
His valour was still the fashion, but his
manners, after so many centuries, and his dress too,
were a little out of date. The new heroism was to
pervade the whole man, and, in order to make him
acceptable, to influence his costume as well as his mind.
There was to be something Roman in him, and something
French; he was to be represented in the style
of Louis the Fourteenth's statues, where the monarch
appears in a Roman tunic and a French wig.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img49.jpg" width="400" height="249" alt="burial of sir guy of warwick." title="" />
<span class="caption">burial of sir guy of warwick.</span>
</div>

<p>The transformation occurred first in France, and was
received with great applause. The times indeed were
most propitious for a display, not of the barbaric
heroism of olden times, but of courtly heroism; of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
heroism which plumes, wigs and ribbons well fitted,
and which, with scarcely any change, could be transferred
from the battle field to the drawing-room, from Rocroy
to the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet: no mean heroism, however,
for all its ribbons. At this period, in France,
manly and lofty virtues, as well as worldly ones, were
worshipped in life, in literature and in art. From the
commencement to the end of the century, examples
of undoubted heroes were not lacking; Henri IV.,
Richelieu, Mme. de Longueville, Cond&eacute;, Louis XIV.,
Turenne, now by their good qualities, now by their
caprices, now by their deeds and now by their looks,
resembled heroes of romance, and popularized in
France an ideal of nobleness and greatness. In order
to please and to be admired, it was necessary to show
a lofty character; men must be superior to fortune,
and women must appear superior to the allurements
of passion; the hero made a display of magnanimity,
the heroine of chastity. The hero won the battle of
Fribourg, and the heroine had Montausier to pay court
to her for thirteen years before she consented to be
united to him in the bonds of wedlock. Such were
the persons most admired in real life; such were the
characters of romance and tragedy whom the public
liked best, without, however, distinguishing between
them. The Cid, Alceste, Artaban, Nicom&egrave;de, as well
as Julie d'Angennes, Montausier and Cond&eacute;, were all
members of the same family, and not any one of them
more than another appeared comic or ridiculous: that
is why Montausier was very far from being offended
that traits of the character of Alceste were thought
to be found in him, and that is why Mme. de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
S&eacute;vign&eacute;, a passionate admirer of Corneille, becomes
as honestly enthusiastic over the extravagant heroes of
the new romances as over those of the great Cornelian
tragedies. "I am mad for Corneille; everything must
yield to his genius ... My daughter, let us take good
care not to compare Racine with him. Let us feel
the difference!"<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> She writes elsewhere with regard
to the heroes of La Calpren&egrave;de: "The beauty of the
sentiments, the violence of the emotions, the grandeur
of the incidents and the miraculous success of their invincible
swords, all that delights me like a young girl."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>This change, which consisted, not of course in the
introduction of heroism into novels, where it had
in all times found place, but in the magnifying, to
an extraordinary degree, of this source of interest,
and in a transformation of costume and of tone of
speech, appeared not only in romances, but in the
drama also, and even in history. Everything worthy
of attention was for many years to be heroical.
Heroes defy earth and heaven; they do not, like
Aucassin, with a temper of ironical submission, give
up Paradise in the hope of joining Nicolete in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
nether world; they make the nether world itself
tremble on its foundations: for nothing can resist
them. Even in serious historical works the old
rulers of the French nation appear under an heroical
garb. King Clovis is thus described by Scipion
Dupleix, historiographer royal, in his "Histoire
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de France," 1634: "The hour of Easter-eve
at which the King was to receive the baptism at the
hands of St. Remy having come, he appeared with a
proud countenance, a dignified gait, a majestic port,
very richly dressed, musked and powdered; his flowing
wig was curiously combed, curled, frizzed, undulated
and perfumed, according to the custom of the old
french Kings;"<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> but much more it seems according
to the custom of less ancient sovereigns; and there
is at the Louvre, a portrait of Louis XIII. bare-legged,
periwigged, ermine-cloaked, which corresponds far better
to this description than anything we know of Clovis.</p>

<p>The same characteristics appear in the epic and the
drama. Antoine de Montchrestien, besides having
written the earliest treatise of political economy, and
thus having stood, if nothing more, godfather to a
new science,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> wrote a number of plays, flavoured
most of them with a grandiloquence and heroism which
give us a foretaste of Dryden. In his "Aman ou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
la vanit&eacute;," he treats the same subject as Racine in his
"Esther," but he has nothing in common with his
successor, and much with the dramatists of the heroical
school. In order, doubtless, to justify from the first
the title of the play, Aman indulges his "vanit&eacute;" in an
opening monologue to the following effect:</p>

<p>"Whether fair Ph&#339;bus coming out of the hollow
waters brings back colour to the face of the world,
whether with his warmer rays he sets day ablaze or
departs to take his rest in his watery bower, he cannot
see in all the inhabited world a single man to be
compared with me for successes of any sort. My glory
is without peer, and if any of the gods were to exchange
heaven for earth and dwell under the lunar
disc, he would content himself with such a brilliant
fortune as mine."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all the dramas of Scud&eacute;ry are made up of
such speeches, and they were the rage in Paris before
Corneille arose, Corneille in whom something of this
style yet lingers. Each of Scud&eacute;ry's heroes, be it in
his dramas, in his epics, in his romances, is like his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Alaric, nothing less than "le vainqueur des vainqueurs
de la terre"; and having conquered all the world is in
his turn conquered by Love. To write thus was supposed
to be following the noble impulse given by the
Renaissance, to be Roman, to outdo Seneca.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>In the novel especially this style shone in all its
lustre and beauty. All the heroes of the interminable
romances of the time, by Gomberville, George and
Madeleine de Scud&eacute;ry, La Calpren&egrave;de and many others,
be they Greek, Roman, Turk or French, are all of
them the conquerors of the world and the captives of
Love. "I can scarcely believe," wrote wise censors,
"that the Cyrus and the Alexanders have suddenly
become, as I hear it reported, so many Thyrsis and
Celadons."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> But their protests were of no avail, for
a time, and romance heroes continued to reign in
France, having had from the first for their palace and
chief place of resort the famous H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>
<p>This hotel had been building from 1610 to 1617 in
the Rue St. Thomas-du-Louvre. Polite society began
to gather there soon after its completion, and began to
desert it only thirty years later. The heroic romances
of the period were among the chief topics of conversation;
and this is easily understood: they were meant
as copies of this same polite society, and of its chiefs;
under feigned names people recognized in Cyrus the
Grand Cond&eacute;; in Mandane, Madame de Longueville;
in Sapho, the authoress herself, Mdlle. de Scud&eacute;ry;
in Aristh&eacute;e, the poet Jean Chapelain. Persons thus
designated often continued in real life to be called by
their romance appellations; thus Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;
is wont to subscribe herself "the very humble servant
of the adorable Amalth&eacute;e."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Men and women considered
it a great honour to have their portraits in a
romance; they felt sure then of going down to the
remotest posterity, a fond belief to which posterity
has already given the lie. Much intrigue went on to
obtain such a valuable favour. While we are scarcely
able now to plod on for a few chapters along the
winding road which led Cyrus to his victories, these
volumes were awaited with intense interest and discussed
with passion as soon as published. Neither the
expectation of the next number of the "Revue des
deux Mondes," when it contains some important new
study of actual life, nor the discussion about the last
play of Dumas, can give us now an adequate idea of
the amount of interest concentrated in Paris at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
time upon those heroical, grandiloquent, periwigged
figures.</p>

<p>And sometimes it was a very long time before the
end of the adventures, and the answers of the lovers
were known. These books were not written without
care and thought and some attention to rules and
style. In the preface to his "Ibrahim" Scud&eacute;ry gives
us a sort of "Ars poetica" for heroic romance writers;
he states what precepts it is necessary to follow, and those
which may sometimes be dispensed with; he informs us
that attention is to be paid to the truth of history,
and that manners must be observed. For example,
in "Ibrahim" he has thought fit to use some Turkish
words, such as "Alla, Stambol"; these he calls
"historical marks," and they correspond to what goes
now under the name of local colour; according to
his way of thinking they give a realistic appearance to
his story. His heroes in this particular romance are
not kings, he confesses; his excuse is that they are
worthy to be such, and that besides they belong to very
good families. He has been careful to use an easy,
flowing style, and to avoid bombast "except in
speeches." He has something to say about the unities,
which have their part to play even in romances.
Nothing must be left to chance in those works; and
as for himself, he would have refused, he declares,
the praise bestowed upon the Greek painter who, by
throwing his brush against his work, obtained thus the
finest effect in his picture. In Scud&eacute;ry's picture everything
is drawn with a will and a purpose, everything is
the result of thought and calculation, and, if we are to
believe him, much art was thus spent by the gallant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Gouverneur de Nostre Dame; much art that is now
entirely concealed from the dim eyes of posterity.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Speeches, with descriptions, letters (which are always
given in full as if they were documents of state),
conversations and incidental anecdotic stories, were
among the most usual means employed to fill up
the many volumes of an ordinary heroical romance.
For the volumes were many: "There never shone
such a fine day as the one which was to be the eve of
the nuptials between the illustrious Aronce and the
admirable Cl&eacute;lie." Such is the beginning of the first
volume of "Cl&eacute;lie, histoire romaine," by Madeleine de
Scud&eacute;ry, published in January, 1649. It happens that
the marriage thus announced is delayed by certain little
incidents, and is only celebrated towards the end of the
tenth and last volume published in September, 1654.
Volume I. contained the famous "Carte du Tendre," to
show the route from "Nouvelle amiti&eacute;" to "Tendre,"
with its various rivers, its villages of "Tendre-sur-Inclination,"
"Tendre-sur-Estime," with the ever-to-be-avoided
hamlets of Indiscretion and Perfidy, the Lake
of Indifference and other frightful countries. Let us
turn away from them and go back to our heroes.</p>

<p>One of their chief pleasures was to tell their own
stories. Of this neither they nor their listeners were
ever tired. Whenever in the course of the tale a new
person is introduced, the first thing he is expected to
do is to tell us who he is and what he has seen of the
world. Sometimes stories are included in his own, and
when the first are finished, instead of taking up again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the thread of the main tale, we merely resume the
hearing of the speaker's own adventures: a custom
which sometimes proves very puzzling to the inattentive
frivolous reader of to-day. As for the
supposed listeners in the tale itself, the men or women
the hero has secured for his audience, they well knew
what to expect, and took their precautions accordingly.
We sometimes see them go to bed in order to listen
more comfortably. In "Cassandre," the eunuch Tireus
has a story to tell to Prince Oroontades: "The prince
went to his bedroom and put himself to bed; he then
had Tireus called to him, and having seats placed in
the <i>ruelle</i>, he commanded us to sit," and then the story
begins; and it goes on for pages; and when it is
finished we observe that it was included in another
story told by Araxe; wherefore, instead of finding ourselves
back among the actors of the principal tale, we
alight only among those in Araxe's narrative.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> These
stories are thus enclosed in one another like Chinese
boxes.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>This literature as soon as imported into England
realized there the most complete success. To find
a parallel for it we must go back to the time when
medi&aelig;val Lancelot and Tristan were sung of by
French singers, and afterwards by singers of all
countries. Cyrus and Mandane, Oroontades and
Tireus, Grand Scipio and Illustrious Bassa, Astr&eacute;e and
C&eacute;ladon, our heroes and our shepherds once more began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the invasion and conquest of the great northern island.
As was to be expected from such unparalleled conquerors,
they accomplished this feat easily, and their
work had consequences in England for which France
can scarcely offer any perfect equivalent. Through
their exertions there arose in this country a dramatic
literature in the heroical style which, thanks especially
to Dryden, has still a literary interest. But in France
our heroes of fiction were curtailed of much of their
glory by the inexorable Boileau. They left, it is true,
some trace of their influence in the works of Corneille
and even of Racine, but the heroic drama, properly so
called, was restricted to the works of the Scud&eacute;rys and
Montchrestiens, which is saying enough to imply that
it was not meant to survive very long.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the century French
romances were in England the main reading of people
who had leisure. They were read in the original, for
French was a current language in society at that time,
and they were read in translations both by society and
by the ordinary public. Most of them were rendered
into English, and so important were these works considered
that sometimes several translators tried their skill
at the same romance, and published independently the
result of their labours, as if their author had been
Virgil or Ariosto, or any classical writer. French
ideas in the matter of novels were adopted so cordially
that not only under Charles I., but even during the
civil war and under Cromwell this rage for reading
and translating did not abate. The contrary, it is
true, has often been asserted, without inquiry, and as
a matter of course; but this erroneous statement was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
due to a mere <i>a priori</i> argument, and had no other
ground than the improbability of the same fashion
predominating in the London of the Roundheads and
the Paris of the Pr&eacute;cieuses. What likelihood was
there of any popularity being bestowed upon heroes
who were nothing if not befeathered heroes, heroes
<i>&agrave; panaches</i> at a time when Puritans reigned supreme,
staunch adversaries as we know of <i>panaches</i>, curls, vain
talk, and every sort of worldly vanity? Was it not
the time when books were published on "The unlovelinesse
of Love-lockes," being "a summarie discourse
prooving the wearing and nourishing of a locke
or love-locke to be altogether unseemely, and unlawfull
unto Christians. In which there are likewise
some passages collected out of Fathers, Councells and
sundry authors and historians against face-painting, the
wearing of supposititious, poudred, frizled or extraordinary
long haire, the inordinate affectation of
corporall beautie, and womens mannish, unnaturall,
impudent, and unchristian cutting of their haire"?<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
So early in the century as 1628 it was thus discovered
that women's short hair and men's long wigs were
equally unchristian. What was to be the fate of our
well-curled heroes? They were received with open
arms. "Polexandre," for example, was published in
English in 1647; "Ibrahim ou l'illustre Bassa,"
"Cassandre," and "Cl&eacute;opatre" in 1652; "Le Grand
Cyrus" in 1653, the very year in which Cromwell
became Protector; the first part of "Cl&eacute;lie" in
1656; "Astr&eacute;e" in 1657; "Scipion" in 1660, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The English prefaces to these French novels plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
showed that, notwithstanding the puritanical taunts of
the party in power, publishers felt no doubt as to the
success of their undertaking. These works were not
spread timidly among the public; they were announced
noisily in the most pompous terms:</p>

<p>"I shall waste no time to tell you how this book
hath sold in France where it was born: since nothing
falls from Monsieur de Scud&eacute;ry's hand, but is receiv'd
there as an unquestionable piece, by all that have a
taste of wit or honour. The translator hath inserted
no false stitches of his own, having only turn'd the
wrong side of the Arras towards us, for all translations,
you know, are no other."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The translator of "Astr&eacute;e" was fain to inform his
readers of a judgment passed, as he pretends, on this
work by "the late famous Cardinall of Richelieu.
That he was not to be admitted in the Academy of
wit who had not been before well read in Astrea."
And he claims for his author a highly beneficial
purpose, that could be condemned by none except obdurate
Puritans: "These are the true designs and ends
of works of this nature: these are academies for the
lover, schools of war for the soldier, and cabinets for
the statesman; they are the correctives of passion, the
restoratives of conversation, ... in a word, the most
delightful accommodations of civill life."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p><p>Another goes so far as to give the lie direct to the
Puritans, to "those morose persons" who condemn
novels; in truth, "delight is the least advantage redounding
from such compositions." French romances
(which seem to have altered somewhat in this respect)
are nothing but a school of morality, generosity, and
self-restraint: "Not to say anything concerning the
ground work which is generally some excellent piece
of ancient history accurately collected out of the
records of the most eminent writers of old, ... the
addition of fictitious adventures is so ingenious, the
incident discourses so handsome, free and fitted for
the improvement of conversation (which is not undeservedly
accounted of great importance to the
contentment of human life), the descriptions of the
passions so lively and naturally set forth; yea the
idea of virtue, generosity and all the qualifications
requisite to accomplish great persons so exquisitely
delineated that ... I must speak it, though I believe
with the envy and regret of many, that [the French]
have approv'd themselves the best teachers of a noble
and generous morality that are to be met with."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes both the engravings and the story were
imported from France. As the illustrations to Harington's
translation of "Ariosto" had been originally
made by an Italian artist, so now French engravings
began to be popularized in England. For example,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
when a translation appeared of "Endimion," the
curious mythological novel of Gombauld, with its
pleasant descriptions and incidents, half dreamy, half
real, the plates from drawings by C. de Pas were
sent over to England and used in the English edition.
Sometimes, too, the English copies had original plates
or engraved titles; but even in these the French
style was usually apparent. Robert Loveday, who
translated La Calpren&egrave;de's "Cl&eacute;opatre," prefaces his
book with one such plate; and it is curious to notice
when reading his published correspondence that the
engraving was made according to his own minute
directions. The bookseller "offer'd to be at the charge
of cutting my own face for the frontispiece, but I
refused his offer." As, however, the publisher insisted
on having something, "I design'd him this which is
now a-cutting: Upon an altar dedicated to Love,
divers hearts transfix'd with arrows and darts are to
lye broiling upon the coals; and upon the steps of it,
Hymen ... in a posture as if he were going to light
[his taper] to the altar; when Cupid is to come
behind him and pull him by the saffron sleeve, with
these words proceeding from his mouth: Nondum
peracta sunt pr&aelig;ludia";<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> a statement that is only too
true and in which Loveday summarizes unawares the
truest criticism levelled at these romances. You may
read volume after volume, and still "nondum peracta
sunt pr&aelig;ludia," you have not yet done with preliminaries.</p>

<p>But this constant delaying of an event, sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
announced, as in "Cl&eacute;lie," at the top of the first page,
was not in the least displeasing to seventeenth-century
readers. The lengthy episodes, the protracted conversations,
enchanted them; it was an age when
conversation was at its height in France, and from
France the taste spread to other countries. Translators,
as we have seen, expressly mentioned as an attraction
in their books the help they would give to conversation.
Numberless examples of this polite pastime are
provided in the heroic romances; in "Almahide, or
the Captive Queen,"<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> among others, we read discussions
as to whether it is better for a man to court
a lady in verse or in prose, whether an illiterate lover is
better than a learned one, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such topics, and many more of a higher order,
which were the subject of persistent debate in the
drawing-rooms of the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, were also
discussed in England; there was, it is true, no H&ocirc;tel
de Rambouillet, but there was the house of the Philips
at Cardigan. There was no Marquise, but there was
Catherine Philips, the "matchless Orinda," who did
much to acclimatize in England the refinements,
elegancies, and heroism <i>&agrave; panache</i> of her French neigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>bours.
With the help of her friends she translated
some of the plays of Corneille, not without adding
something to the original to make it look more
heroical. The little society gathered round her imitated
the feigned names bestowed upon the habitu&eacute;s
of the Parisian hotel. While she went by the name of
Orinda, plain Mr. Philips, her husband, was re-baptized
Antenor; her friend Sir Charles Cotterel, translator of
"Cassandre," was Poliarchus; a lady friend, Miss
Owen, was Lucasia;<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> fine names, to be sure, which
unfortunately will remind many a reader not only of
matchless Arthenice, of the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, but
of Moli&egrave;re's Cathos and Madelon, who, too, had chosen
to imitate the Marquise, and insisted on being called
Aminte and Polix&egrave;ne, to the astonishment of their
honest father.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>The high morality and delicacy, both of the
"H&ocirc;tel," and, alas, of Moli&egrave;re's "Pr&eacute;cieuses," were
also imitated at Cardigan. To get married was a
thing so coarse and vulgar that people with refined
souls were to slip into that only at the last extremity.
"A fine thing it would be," says the Madelon of the
"Pr&eacute;cieuses," "if from the first Cyrus were to marry
Mandane and if Aronce were all at once wedded to
Clelia!" We have seen that such is not the case, and
that ten volumes of adventures interpose between their
love and their marriage. In the same way an eternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
friendship, a marriage of soul to soul, having been
sworn between Orinda and Lucasia, it was a matter of
great sorrow, shame and despair for the first when the
second, after thirteen years of this refined intercourse
proved frail and commonplace enough to marry a lover
of appropriate age, fortune and position.</p>

<p>Another centre for heroic thoughts and refined
morality was the country house of the pedantic but
pretty Duchess of Newcastle, a prolific writer of essays,
letters, plays, poems, tales, and works of all kinds. To
her, literature was a compensation for the impossibility,
through want of opportunity, of performing with her
own hand heroical deeds: "I dare not examine," says
she, "the former times, for fear I should meet with such
of my sex that have out-done all the glory I can aime
at or hope to attaine; for I confess my ambition is
restless, and not ordinary; because it would have an
extraordinary fame. And since all heroick actions,
publick employments, powerfull governments and
eloquent pleadings are denyed our sex in this age

<p>She wrote a great deal, and not without feeling a
somewhat deep and na&iuml;vely expressed admiration for
her own performances. The epithet "restless" which
she applies to her ambition, well fits her whole mind;
there is restlessness about everything she did and
wrote. She is never satisfied with one epistle to the
reader; she must have ten or twelve prefaces and under-prefaces,
which forcibly remind us of her contemporary,
Oronte, in his famous sonnet scene with Alceste. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
"Natures pictures drawn by Fancies pencil to the life"
is preceded by several copies of commendatory verses and
a succession of preambles, entitled: "To the reader&mdash;An
epistle to my readers&mdash;To the reader&mdash;To the
reader&mdash;To my readers&mdash;To my readers"; each being
duly signed "M. Newcastle." It seems as if the sight
of her own name was a pleasure to her. These
prefaces are full of expostulations, explanations and
apologies, quite in the Oronte style: "The design of
these my feigned stories, is to present virtue, the muses
leading her and the graces attending her.... Perchance
my feigned stories are not so lively described as they
might have been.... As for those tales I name
romancicall, I would not have my readers think I
write them either to please or to make foolish whining
lovers.... I must entreat my readers to understand,
that though my naturall genius is to write fancy, yet
... Although I hope every piece or discourse in my
book will delight my readers or at least some one, and
some another ... yet I do recommend two as the
most solid and edifying." Great is the temptation to
answer with Alceste: "Nous verrons bien!"<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> But
how could one say so when she was so pretty? The
best preface to her volumes is in fact the charming
engraving representing a party meeting at her house to
tell and hear tales round the fire, and of which we give
a reproduction. The only pity is that the figure meant
as her portrait, though laurel-crowned, looks much
more plain and commonplace than we might have
expected.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>
<p>She wrote then abundantly "romancicall" tales, as
she called them, with a touch of heroism; edifying tales
in which she prescribes "that all young men should be
kept to their studies so long as their effeminate
beauties doth last;" dialogues "of the wise lady, the
learned lady and the witty lady," the three being only
too wise; plays in which she depicts herself under the
names of Lady Sanspareile, of Lady Chastity, &amp;c.,
unpardonable sins, no doubt, to give oneself such
names; but it is reported she was so beautiful!</p>

<p>Among the mass of her writings, it must be added,
ideas are scattered here and there which were destined
to live, and through which she anticipated men of true
and real genius. To give only one example, she too
may be credited with having anticipated Richardson in
her "Sociable Letters," in which she tries to imitate
real life, to describe scenes, very nearly to write an
actual novel: "The truth is," she writes, "they are
rather scenes than letters, for I have endeavoured under
cover of letters to express the humors of mankind, and
the actions of man's life by the correspondence of two
ladies, living at some short distance from each other,
which make it not only their chief delight and pastime,
but their tye in friendship, to discourse by letters as
they would do if they were personally together."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
Many collections of imaginary letters had, as we have
seen, been published before, but never had the use to
which they could be put been better foreseen by any
predecessor of Richardson.</p>

<p>The Duchess lived till 1674, surrounded by an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>ever-increasing
group of admirers, deaf to the jokes of
courtly people concerning her old-fashioned chastity;
more than consoled by the firm belief she had as
to the strength of her mind and genius. In this
persuasion "she kept," wrote Theophilus Cibber, "a
great many young ladies about her person, who occasionally
wrote what she dictated. Some of them slept
in a room contiguous to that in which Her Grace lay,
and were ready at the call of her bell to rise any hour
of the night to write down her conceptions, lest they
should escape her memory. The young ladies no doubt
often dreaded Her Grace's conceptions, which were
frequent."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Here, again, her restless spirit was in
some manner anticipating unawares another great writer,
namely, Pope.</p>

<p>Thus, in spite of Cromwell and the Puritans on the
one side, and Charles II. and his courtiers on the other,
French ideas as to the possible dignity and purity of
lives in which the worldly element was not wanting
grew to some extent on the English soil, though, it is
true, with less success, being as we see mainly relegated
at that time to the country. The true hour for virtues
not the less real because sociable, virtues such as they
were understood by Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; or Madame
de Rambouillet, had not yet come. They were to be
thoroughly acclimatized only in the next century,
principally through the exertions of Steele and Addison.</p>

<p>But the strictly heroical part of French tastes was
accepted immediately and with great enthusiasm. The
extraordinary number of folio heroical romances still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
to be seen in old English country houses testifies
at the present day to their extraordinary hold upon
the polite society of the time. The King gave the
example. Charles I. had been a reader of such novels;
on the eve of his death he distributed a few souvenirs
to his most faithful friends, and we see him give
away, besides Hooker's "Ecclesiastical Polity" and
Dr. Andrews' sermons, the romance of "Cassandre,"
which he left to the Earl of Lindsey. During the
troublous times of the civil war, Dorothy Osborne
constantly alludes, in her letters to Sir William Temple,
to the books she reads, and they are mostly these same
French novels. While troops are marching to and fro;
while rebellions and counter-rebellions are preparing or
breaking out, the volumes of "Cl&eacute;opatre" and "Grand
Cyrus" go to and fro between the lovers and are the
subject of their epistolary discussions. "Have you read
'Cl&eacute;opatre'? I have six tomes on't here that I can
lend you if you have not; there are some stories in't
you will like, I believe."&mdash;"Since you are at leisure
to consider the moon, you may be enough to read
'Cl&eacute;opatre,' therefore I have sent you three volumes....
There is a story of Artimise that I will recommend
to you; her disposition I like extremely, it
has a great deal of practical wit; and if you meet
with one Brittomart, pray send me word how you like
him."&mdash;"I have a third tome here [of "Cyrus"] against
you have done with that second; and to encourage
you, let me assure you that the more you read of
them, you will like them still better,"<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and so on.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>
<p>The wife of Mr. Pepys was not less fond of French
romances than Dorothy Osborne, and we sometimes
find her husband purchasing copies at his bookseller's
to bring home as presents. But he himself did not
like them very much; he seems to have been deterred
from this kind of literature by his wife's habit of
reciting stories to him out of these works; some quarrel
even took place between the couple about "Cyrus,"
though it seems that "Cyrus" was in this case more the
pretext than the reason of the discussion, as honest Pepys
with his usual frankness gives us to understand: "At
noon home, where I find my wife troubled still at my
checking her last night in the coach in her long stories
out of 'Grand Cyrus,' which she would tell, though
nothing to the purpose, nor in any good manner.
This she took unkindly, and I think I was to blame
indeed; but she do find with reason that in the
company of Pierce, Knipp, or other women that I love
I do not value her as I ought. However very good
friends by and by." As a penance doubtless we see
him buying for her later "L'Illustre Bassa in four
volumes" and "Cassandra and some other French
books."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>But reading and translating was not enough for a
society so enamoured of heroical romances; some
original ones were to be composed for English readers
and the composing of them became a fashionable
pastime. "My lord Broghill," writes again Dorothy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Osborne to her future husband, Sir William Temple,
the patron hereafter of the yet unborn Jonathan Swift,
"sure will give us something worth the reading. My
Lord Saye, I am told, has writ a romance since his
retirement in the isle of Lundy, and Mr. Waller they
say is making one of our wars, which if he does not
mingle with a great deal of pleasing fiction, cannot
be very diverting, sure, the subject is so sad."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>The following year, that is 1654, the English public
received, according to Dorothy's previsions, the first
instalment of the most noticeable heroical romance
composed in their language. It was called "Parthenissa,"<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
and had for its author Roger Boyle, Lord
Broghill, afterwards Earl of Orrery, one of the matchless
Orinda's great friends.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>In this heroic romance, the imitation of France is
as exact as possible; the few literary qualities perceptible
in the vast compositions of Mdlle. de Scud&eacute;ry and
of La Calpren&egrave;de, do not shine with any brighter lustre
in "Parthenissa." As in France ancient history is put to
the torture, though Scud&eacute;ry, as we have seen, had set up
as a rule that the truth of history was to be respected in
romances; of observation of nature there is little or none,
and the conversations of the characters are interminable.
"Turning over the leaves of the large folio," wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
one of the last critics who busied themselves with this
work, "I perceived that ... the story some-how or
other brought in Hannibal, Massinissa, Mithridates,
Spartacus, and other persons equally well known....
How they came into the story or what the story is
I cannot tell you; nor will any mortal know any
more than I do, between this and doomsday; but
there they all are, lively though invisible, like carp
in a pond."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> We must make bold, though doomsday
has not yet come, to draw forth some of these carp
out of the water, and, after all, this is not the darkest
pond in which we shall have fished.</p>

<p>At the commencement, Boyle introduces us to a
young and handsome stranger who comes to Syria
in order to consult the oracle of Venus. The priest
Callimachus appears before him, and quite suddenly
asks for his history. The stranger is very willing to
tell it. His name is Artabanes and he is the son of
the King of Parthia; he is in love with the Princess
Parthenissa and has proved his affection for her in the
manner of Sidney's heroes: he met on one occasion
an Arab prince, who was travelling with a collection
of twenty-four pictures, representing the mistresses
of twenty-four famous champions overthrown by him.
Artabanes in his turn measured swords with the Arab
and got possession of the twenty-four paintings, and
one in addition, which represented the mistress of his
adversary: whence it results that Parthenissa is the
most beautiful woman in the world, exactly what the
hero intended to prove.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>
<p>Artabanes has a rival, Surena; he fancies that Surena
is the happy man, leaves Parthenissa and goes to live
in solitude. Pirates carry him off, and sell him at Rome
for a slave. Then under the name of Spartacus, he stirs
up a revolt and accomplishes exploits attributed by
ancient writers to that rebel; however he does not die
as in history, but returns to Asia. There, Parthenissa,
rather than surrender to a lover, swallows a drug and
dies; but hers is only an apparent death and she returns
to life. Artabanes, in the same way, stabs himself, but
he is cured; and then it is that he comes to consult the
oracle.</p>

<p>Callimachus thanks him for his interesting but
somewhat lengthy story, and revenges himself by
relating his own. Unfortunately he is interrupted:
they see a lady who looks exactly like Parthenissa
herself enter a neighbouring grove; she is accompanied
by a young cavalier; they embrace and disappear
among the trees. Artabanes' anguish at this sight
cannot be described. But here Roger Boyle found
that he was tired and wrote no more. His romance,
which already comprised five parts, was published by
him in this unfinished form.</p>

<p>For a long time the public was left in suspense.
The Protector was dead, his son had fallen, the Stuarts
had again ascended the throne, and no one knew the
end of the loves of Prince Artabanes. The continuation
of the romance is due to the charming Henrietta
of England, Duchess of Orleans. Ten or twelve years
after the appearance of the first volume, she was curious
to know what Parthenissa was doing in the wood, and
begged Roger Boyle to bring her out of it. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
wrote a sixth part in four books and dedicated it to
her.</p>

<p>Are we to imagine that the author is now going to
lead his impatient readers in search of the heroine?
Not at all. Callimachus, who was unfairly interrupted
in his tale, proposes to his companions to leave one of
them, Symander, on guard, and to go and refresh
themselves. When they were rested, "they conjur'd
him to prosecute his story, though what they had seen
and heard gave them impatiences which nothing but
their desires of knowing so generous a friend's fortunes
could have dispensed with." The four books of the
sixth part are devoted to this narrative; Boyle, as he
said in his preface, had thought at first of concluding
everything in this supplement; but he was forced to
recognize that it was impossible to "confine it within
so narrow a compass." This statement will be found
on page 808 of his folio volume. Why Parthenissa
entered the grove was never to be known nor
what she had to say in her justification. Boyle, who
had taken up his pen again at the instance of the
young duchess, had very soon no reason to continue:
Bossuet was calling on the court of the Grand Roi
to weep with him for the loss of this charming woman,
whose beauty and grace had only blossomed "for one
morning."</p>

<p>As soon as the book was out, Dorothy Osborne had
a copy sent to her, but she did not like it so much as
the French models. She writes to Temple: "I'll ...
tell you that 'Parthenissa' is now my company. My
brother sent it down and I have almost read it. 'Tis
handsome language; you would know it to be writ by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
person of good quality though you were not told it;
but on the whole I am not very much taken with it.
All the stories have too near a resemblance with those
of other romances; there is nothing new and <i>surprenant</i>
in them; the ladies are all so kind they make no
sport."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Boyle, it is said, besides his dramas and other works,
again tried his fortune as a novel writer, and published
in 1676 "English Adventures by a person of honour."
It is in a style so absolutely different from his former
romance that it is scarcely credible that both came from
the same pen. "English Adventures" tell the story
of the amours of King Henry VIII., of Brandon, and
others. All the reserve in "Parthenissa" has entirely
disappeared, and scenes are presented to the eye which,
except at the time of the Restoration, have usually been
veiled. Love is in this novel the subject of many discussions,
and so it was in heroic romances, but while it
was spoken of there with decency and dignity, it is
never mentioned in "English Adventures" but in a
tone of banter and raillery. The discourses about this
passion recall Suckling's ideas much more than those
of Madeleine de Scud&eacute;ry. "Pardon me, madam, Wilmore
reply'd, if I think you mistake the case, for I
never said I was for a siege in Love: that is the dull
method of those countries whose discipline in amours I
abominate. I am for the French mode, where the first
day, I either conquer my mistress or my passion."
Whether or not this be according to "the French
mode," we are obviously very far from the Montausier
ideal. The author continues: "Nor indeed did I ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
see any woman (I mean in France) cry up constancy,
but she was decaying; for when any thing but love is
to maintain love 'tis a proof Beauty cannot do it, and
then, alas, nothing else can."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> If this and the very
licentious adventures which follow are really Boyle's, it
must be conceded that the change worked upon him by
the new Restoration manners was indeed vast and comprehensive.</p>

<p>Other original attempts at the heroical romance were
made in England at this period. It will be enough
to mention one more. The two main defects of the
heroical dramas of Dryden and his contemporaries are
bombast in the ideas and bad taste in the expressions.
In Crowne's heroical novel of "Pandion and Amphigenia"<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
both defects are pushed to an extreme which,
incredible as it may seem to the readers of Dryden, was
never at any time reached by the laureate.</p>

<p>The story is the usual heroical story of valorous
deeds and peerless loves; the author is careful to assert
that he is perfectly original: "All ... is genuine,
nothing stole, nothing strained." He has been especially
careful to avoid imitating the French and the elegancies
of "that ceremonious nation." After such a declaration
we are rather surprised to hear Periander thus
answer a lady who, in the usual way, had asked him for
his inevitable story: "Madam," said he, "your expressions
speak you no less rich in virtue than beauty....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
I should be more savage then the beasts that Orpheus
charmed into civility, should I remain inexorable to the
intreaties of so sweet an orator, whose perfections are
such that I cannot but account it as great a glory to
obey you, as it would make me sensible of shame to
refuse any thing you should command, though it were to
sacrifice my life and honour, which are the only jewels
I ever prized in my prosperity, and which is all that
Fortune hath left to my disposal in my adversity."
Then he tells his story, which we had better not
listen to, for it begins: "Know you then that in the
city of Corinth, there dwelt a gentleman called
Eleutherius ...," and we know full well what such
beginnings threaten. The romance goes on describing
bloody feuds and matchless beauties. Here is in characteristic
style a portrait of a matchless beauty:</p>

<p>"The pillow blest with a kiss from her cheeks, as
pregnant with delight, swelled on either side.... A
lock that had stollen from its sweet prison, folded in
cloudy curls, lay dallying with her breath, sometimes
striving to get a kiss, and then repulsed flew back,
sometimes obtaining its desired bliss, and then as rapt
with joy, retreated in wanton caperings.... Her breasts
at liberty displayed were of so pure a whiteness as if
one's eye through the transparent skin, had viewed the
milky treasures they inclosed."</p>

<p>Oh! for a Boileau, shall we exclaim, to cut off the
flowers of such paper gardens! for a Defoe to show
how prose fiction should be written! But Boileau is
abroad and Defoe's time is yet to come. Wait, besides,
for this is nothing and we have better in store; that
was love, here is war:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>"The signal for the battail being given, there began
such a terrible conflict, as that within a short time
thousands lay dead in the place, both sides maintaining
their assaults with such impetuous rage as if the Gyants
had been come to heap mountains of carcasses to assail
heaven and besiege the gods; nothing but fury reigned
in every breast, some that were thrust through with
lances would yet run themselves farther on to reach
their enemies and requite that mortal wound ... the
earth grew of a sanguine complexion, being covered
with blood, as if every soldier had been Death's herald,
and had come to emblazon Mars's arms with a sword
Argent on a field Gules.... In one place, lay heads
deposed from their sovereignties, yawning and staring
as if they looked for their bodies."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> One refreshing
thought is the remembrance of the pure, deep pleasure
Crowne must have found in fastening together such an
unparalleled series of conceits. "Peste," is he sure to
have said with Sosie:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Peste! o&ugrave; prend mon esprit toutes ces gentillesses?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As for the final result of these wars and love-makings,
it is a very airy one; for Crowne seems to have entertained
a higher ideal of purity than even Montausier
and Orinda. His ladies bestow upon their lovers
nothing at all, not even marriage, and the author, after
having been at some trouble to re-establish order in
Thessaly and other countries, gives up all idea of
getting Pandion and Amphigenia wedded, this lady, she
of the pillow above described, being as he says so very
"coy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>Though not quite a match for Crowne's it must be
conceded that neither is Dryden's bombast of a mean
order. The following passage which very nearly bears
comparison with the above, will show how heroism
appeared when transferred to the stage. In one of the
dramas, the plot of which Dryden took from the French
romances, Almanzor thus addresses a rival:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If from thy hands alone my death can be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am immortal and a god to thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That I must stoop ere I can give the blow:<br /></span>

<p>Any number of speeches of this sort are to be
found in the heroical dramas of Dryden, Settle, Lee,
and their contemporaries. Roman, Arab, Turk, Greek
or Moorish heroes, pirates or princes, when they mean
to set anything at defiance, choose nothing less than
heaven and earth as their object; they divide the
world between them as if it were an orange; they rush
to the fight or stop for a speech with a fine shake of
the head which sends a majestic undulation round the
wig worn by them, even by the Moors, as we may
see in one of the very rare dramas then published with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
engravings. They are represented there with embroidered
justaucorps, wigs and ribbons.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>Crowne besides his romance wrote several dramas that
secured him a wide, if temporary, popularity. He also
adapted Racine's "Andromaque" for the English stage,
but he was very much disgusted with this work; the
French original, though not "the worst" of French plays,
was after all so mean and tame! "If the play be barren
of fancy, you must blame the original author. I am as
much inclined to be civil to strangers as any man; but
then they must be strangers of merit. I would no more
be at the pains to bestow wit (if I had any) on a
French play, than I would be at the cost to bestow
cloaths on every shabby Frenchman that comes over."
Here we have Racine put in his proper place;
what claim had he to be considered "a stranger of
merit"? True, some crabbed English critics seem to
have taken his part against the translator, and, incredible
as it may seem, they have expressed a thought
that "this suffered much in the translation.&mdash;I cannot
tell in what," answers Crowne, "except in not
bestowing verse upon it, which I thought it did not
deserve. For otherwise, there is all that is in the
French play, verbatim, and something more, as may
be seen in the last act, where what is dully recited
in the French play is there represented, which is no
small advantage."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> And true, it is, Pyrrhus is slain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
before our eyes; there are "alarums" and other lively,
if customary, ornaments.</p>

<p>In this age obviously Racine could not please. Nor
would Shakespeare have pleased a French audience,
but as we know no attempt in that direction was made
in Paris. The two nations lent one another, if anything,
their defects. "Alaric" was named with praise by Dryden;
Scud&eacute;ry and La Calpren&egrave;de continued to be most popular
French authors during the century. Even in the next
we find something remaining of their fame. Among
the books in the library of the fashionable Leonora,
Addison notices: "'Cassandra,' 'Cleopatra,' 'Astr&aelig;a' ...
the 'Grand Cyrus,' with a pin stuck in one of the
middle leaves ... 'Clelia,' which opened of it self
in the place that describes two lovers in a bower,"<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> &amp;c.
The passions in them which seem to us now so incredibly
frigid, had not yet cooled down; their warmth
was still felt: so much so that in one of Farquhar's
plays, "Cassandra" is mentioned as greatly responsible
for Lady Lurewell's first and greatest fault, the beginning
of many others: "After supper I went to my
chamber and read 'Cassandra,' then went to bed and
dreamt of it all night, rose in the morning and made
verses ..."<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> We cannot follow her in her account
of the consequences.</p>

<p>All that was truly noble and simple in French literature
was known, but at the same time generally misunderstood
in England. To make French authors acceptable,
grossness was added to Moli&egrave;re, bombast to Racine;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
even Otway, when translating "B&eacute;r&eacute;nice," transformed
Racine's "Titus" into a bully of romance who, in order
to assuage his grief, goes to overrun "the Universe"
and make "the worlds" as wretched as he is.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Madame
de la Fayette had shown how it was possible to copy
from life, in a novel, true heroism and true tenderness
without exaggeration; her exquisite masterpiece was
translated of course as was everything then that was
French; but oblivion soon gathered round the
"Princess of Cleve," and the only proof we have
that it did not pass unnoticed is a clumsy play by
Lee, in which this best of old French novels is mercilessly
caricatured.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> There was no attempt to imitate
the Comtesse's pure and perfect style and high train of
thought.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Reaction against the heroical romances did not wait,
however, till the eighteenth century to assert itself in
England; it set in early and very amusingly: but it
remained powerless. As the evil had chiefly come from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
France, so did the remedy; but the remedy in France
proved sufficient for a cure. In that country at all times
the tale had flourished, and at all times in the tale, to the
detriment of chivalry and heroism, writers had prided
themselves on seeking mere truth. Thus, in the charming
preface of the Reine de Navarre's "Heptam&eacute;ron," Dame
Parlamente establishes the theory of these narratives,
and relates how, at the court, it had been decided to
write a series of them, but to exclude from the number
of their authors "those who should have studied and be
men of letters; for Monseigneur the Dauphin did not
wish their artifice to be introduced into them, and was
also afraid lest the beauty of rhetoric should in some
place injure the truth of the tale."</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, the tradition of the old
story-tellers is carried on in France in more developed
writings, in actual novels, such as the "Baron de F&#339;neste"
of D'Aubign&eacute;, 1617; the "Francion" of Charles
Sorel, 1622(?); the "Berger extravagant" of the same,
1628; the "Roman Comique" of Scarron, 1651; the
"Roman bourgeois" of Fureti&egrave;re, 1666, and many
others. Scarron, who had travestied Virgil, was not the
man to spare La Calpren&egrave;de, and he does not lose his
opportunity. "I cannot exactly tell you," he writes of
one of his characters, "whether he had sup'd that night,
or went to bed empty, as some Romance-mongers use
to do, who regulate all their heroes' actions, making
them rise early, and tell on their story till dinner time,
then dine lightly, and after their meal proceed in the
discourse: or else retire to some shady grove to talk by
themselves, unless they have something to discover to
the rocks and trees."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>Fureti&egrave;re, writing in the same spirit, declares that he
wishes to concern himself with "persons who are neither
heroes nor heroines, who will neither raise armies nor
overturn kingdoms; but who will be good people of
middling rank who quietly go on their usual way, of
whom some are handsome and others plain, some wise
and others foolish; and the latter have the appearance
indeed of forming the greatest number."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Without speaking of the more important works of
Cervantes and Rabelais,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> most of these novels were
translated into English, and in the same spirit as they
had been written, that is, to be used as engines of war
against heroes and heroism. "The French themselves,"
writes one of the translators, "our first romantique
masters ... have given over making the world otherwise
than it was; are now come to represent it to us as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
it is and ever will be."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> "Among all the books that
ever were thought on," writes another, who curiously
enough had about the same opinion of the favourite
novels of his time as Sidney had had of the drama a
century earlier, "those of knight errantry and shepherdry
have been so excellently trivial and naughty,
that it would amuse a good judgment to consider into
what strange and vast absurdities some imaginations
have straggled ... the Knight constantly killing the
gyant, or it may be whole squadrons; the Damosel
certainly to be relieved just upon the point of ravishing;
a little childe carried away out of his cradle after some
twenty years discovered to be the sone of some great
prince; a girl after seven years wandring and co-habiting
and being stole, confirmed to be a virgin,
either by a panterh, fire or a fountain, and lastly all
ending in marriage ... These are the noble entertainments
of books of this kinde, which how profitable
they are, you may judge; how pernicious 'tis easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
seen, if they meet but with an intentive melancholy and
a spirit apt to be overborn by such follies;"<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> a spirit,
in fact, such as Lady Lurewell's, whose reading of
"Cassandra" had, as we have seen, such remarkable
consequences.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Efforts made in England to imitate this style and to
lead, by means of the romance itself, a reaction against
the false heroism that the romance had introduced,
proved sadly abortive. These attempts have fallen into
a still more profound oblivion than those of the story-tellers
of Shakespeare's time. The English were not
yet masters of the supple, crisp and animated language
which suited that kind of tale, and which the French
possessed from the thirteenth century. A few original
minds like Sidney in his "Apologie" had employed it;
but they formed rare exceptions, and in the seventeenth
century most men continued to like either the pompous
prose with its Latin periods, held in highest honour
by Bacon, or the various kinds of flowery prose used
by Lodge, Greene, Shakespeare and Sidney. So the
romance writers who attempted to bring about a reaction
received no encouragement and were forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
less from want of merit than because even their contemporaries
paid no attention to them. Thinking to
open up a new path, they got entangled in a blind
alley where they were left. The ground was to be
broken anew by more robust hands than theirs, the
hands of Defoe.</p>

<p>Some of these attempts however are worthy of attention,
notably one in which imitation of Scarron and
Fureti&egrave;re is to be found, entitled "The Adventures of
Covent Garden."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The scene is laid in London among
the cultivated upper middle class: life is so realistically
represented, that this work, now entirely unknown, is
one of those that best aid us to re-constitute that
society in which Dryden, Wycherley and Otway
lived.</p>

<p>Peregrine, the hero of the tale, spends his evenings
at the "Rose" or at "Will's," Dryden's favourite
coffee-house, or at the theatre, where the "Indian Emperor,"
one of Dryden's heroic dramas, was being played.
With the Lady Selinda, in whose box he sits, he
discusses the merits of the play, the value of the French
rules and the license of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson.
Many interesting remarks occur in these conversations
which seem put in writing after nature, and are very
curious in the history of literature. If they do not
exactly recall the Moli&egrave;re of the "Critique de l'Ecole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
des Femmes," they will recall Fureti&egrave;re, no insignificant
praise. It is, besides, a compliment difficult to apply
to any other English novelist of the period. Here is a
specimen of literary criticism if not deep, at least lively,
such as was going on at the play, or in the drawing-rooms
at the time of the Restoration:</p>

<p>"You criticks, said Selinda, make a mighty sputter
about exactness of plot, unity of time, place and I know
not what, which I can never find do any play the least
good (Peregrine smiled at her female ignorance). But,
she continued, I have one thing to offer in this dispute,
which I think sufficient to convince you. I suppose the
chief design of plays is to please the people,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> and get
the playhouse and poet a livelihood?</p>

<p>"You must pardon me, madam, replyed Peregrine,
Instruction is the business of plays.</p>

<p>"Sir, said the lady, make it the business of the
audience first to be pleased with instruction, and then I
shall allow you it to be the chief end of plays.</p>

<p>"But, suppose, madam, said he, that I grant what
you lay down.</p>

<p>"Then sir, answered she, you must allow that
whatever plays most exactly answer this aforesaid end
are most exact plays. Now I can instance you many
plays, as all those by Shakespeare and Johnson, and the
most of Mr. Dryden's which you criticks quarrel at as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
irregular, which nevertheless still continue to please the
audience and are a continual support to the Theatre.
There is very little of your unity of time in any of
them, yet they never fail to answer the proposed end
very successfully.... Certainly, these rules are ill
understood, or our nature has changed since they were
made, for we find they have no such effects now as they
had formerly. For instance, I am told the 'Double
Dealer' and 'Plot and no Plot' are two very exact
plays, as you call them, yet all their unity of time,
place and action neither pleased the audience nor got
the poets money. A late play called 'Beauty in
distress,'<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in which the author no doubt sweat as much
in confining the whole play to one scene, as the scene-drawers
should, were it to be changed a hundred times,
this play had indeed a commendatory copy from Mr.
Dryden, but I think he had better have altered the
scene and pleased the audience; in short, had these
plays been a little more exact as you call it, they had
all been exactly damn'd."</p>

<p>Further, some traits of character almost worthy of
Fielding are to be remarked in the course of the tale,
though, it is true, it grows confused towards the end,
and touches the melodramatic in the same way as Nash's
novel. Thus the above conversation is interrupted
by the entrance of the coquette Emilia, long before
loved by Peregrine who had vainly asked for her hand.
"Peregrine would have answered, but a pluck by the
sleeve obliged him to turn from Selinda to entertain
a lady mask'd who had given him the nudg. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
presently knew her to be Emilia, who whispered him
in the ear: I find sir, what Guyomar said just now is
very true:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That love which first took root will first decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of a fresher date will longer stay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peregrine tho surprised was pleased with her pretty
reprimand, being delivered without any anger, <i>but in
murmuring, complaining accents, which never fail to
move</i> ..."</p>

<p>Thus again, Peregrine goes to the famous St. Bartholomew
fair, which was still, as in Ben Jonson's
time, a place of general meeting. "Lord C." is
there discovered, who had a masked lady with him;
she pulls off her mask and smiles at Peregrine, who
again recognizes Emilia. The mixed impressions that
this sight makes on the hero are analysed in these
terms:</p>

<p>"He took a secret pride in rivalling so great a man,
and it confirmed his great opinion of Emilia's beauty to
see her admir'd by so accomplish't a person and absolute
a courtier as my lord C. These considerations augmenting
his love increased his jealousy also, and every
little familiarity that my Lord us'd, heightened his love
to her and hatred to his Lordship; he lov'd her for
being admir'd by my Lord, yet hated my Lord for
loving her."</p>

<p>The vain woman for her part is sufficiently interested
in Peregrine to put a stop to a dawning passion which
she discovers in him for another woman, and which
might have ended in a marriage; but not at any
rate enough to repay his sacrifice by true love. Emilia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
artifices are studied with much skill, and the author
seems, here too, to be imitating nature, and recounting
personal experiences: "<i>Quorum pars magna fui</i>,"
as he says on the title-page of his book. At one time
Emilia feels that Peregrine is escaping her; what does
she conceive will keep him attached to her? At such a
crisis she is shrewd enough not to resort to vulgar
coquetries, feeling that they are no longer in season.
With excellent instinct she guesses that the only means
of recovering possession of honest Peregrine is to appeal
to his good heart: instead of promising him her favours,
she asks of him a service. Peregrine would have despised
himself had he not rendered it, and it is only
afterwards that he perceives his chain is by this means
newly forged. Emilia has fixed ideas on the usefulness
of men of this sort, and puts them very clearly before
Lord C. Only unsubstantial favours must ever be
granted them, in order that the favours by which they
see their rivals profit, may not give them too gloomy
suspicions. They are very useful for defending publicly
their mistress' honour; they must if possible be men
of a lofty and refined mind, for only such persons are
simple enough to feed their passions on nothing.</p>

<p>The direct satire and caricature of heroical novels in
the style of Scud&eacute;ry and La Calpren&egrave;de, which had
been also practised in France, is to be found in a
few English tales, of which the best, as entirely forgotten
as the worst, is entitled "Zelinda, an excellent
new romance, translated from the French of Monsieur
de Scud&eacute;ry."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> With an amusing unconcern, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
very lively pen, the author hastens, on the first page,
to give the lie to his title, and to inveigh against the
impertinences of publishers in general. "Book-sellers
too are grown such saucy masterly companions, they
do even what they please; my friend Mr. Bentley calls
this piece an excellent romance; there I confess his
justice and ingenuity. But then he stiles it a translation,
when (as Sancho Panca said in another case) 'tis
no more so then the mother that bore me. Ingrateful
to envy his friend's fame.... But I write not for
glory, nor self-interest, nor to gratifie kindness nor
revenge. Now the impertinent critical reader will be
ready to ask, for what then? For that and all other
questions to my prejudice, I will borrow Mr. Bays's
answer and say, Because&mdash;I gad sir, I will not tell
you&mdash;I desire to please but one person in the world,
and, as one dedicates his labours and heroes to Calista,
another to Urania, &amp;c., at the feet of her my adored
Celia, I lay all my giants and monsters."</p>

<p>There follows a story in the manner of Scud&eacute;ry, the
plot of which, however, is drawn not from Scud&eacute;ry, but
from Voiture,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and which is treated in a playful accent,
and with an air of persiflage that reminds us of Byron's
tone when relating the adventures of Don Juan. It is
Voiture indeed, but Voiture turned inside-out. As
with Byron, the raillery is from time to time interrupted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>by poetical flights, and, as with him, licentious
scenes abound and are described with peculiar complacency.</p>

<p>Alcidalis and Zelinda, both pursued by a contrary
fate, adore one another, but at a distance: for tempests,
pirates, family feuds separate them, according to the
classical standard of the grave romances of the day.
They mutually seek one another; Alcidalis, who only
dreams of Zelinda, has every good fortune he does
not want. He believes his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> has been married
to an elderly Italian duke distractedly in love with
the young princess: "As we are never so fond of
flowers, as in the beginning of spring, or towards the
end of autumne; the first for their novelty, and the
others because we think we shall see them no more:
so the pleasures of love are at no time so dear to us as
in the beginning of our youth and the approaches of
our age." Alcidalis, deceiving the jealous vigilance of
the duke, makes the tour of a promontory in a boat by
night, climbs to a window by means of a rope-ladder,
and in the second visit gains the favour of the duchess,
who was not at all the lady whom he thought to find.
"Ye gods! do I again behold the fair Zelinda? cries
Alcidalis in his joy (a very pertinent question, for it
is to be remembred there was no light)."</p>

<p>Very unseasonably the husband arrives; Alcidalis has
as much difficulty in escaping as Don Juan; and the
duchess, just like the first mistress of Byron's hero,
bursts out into reproaches against her bewildered husband,
who has much trouble to obtain her pardon. "O
woman! woman!" continues the author in an apostrophe
Byron would not have disowned; "thou dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
abysse of subtility; 'tis easier to trace a wandring
swallow through the pathless air, then to explicate
the crafty wyndings of thy love or malice."</p>

<p>During this time, Alcidalis in flight, comes "to the
sea side, where a ship being just ready to leave the
port (for that must never be wanting to a hero upon
a ramble)," he gets on board and resumes his search
for the true Zelinda. He encounters many new adventures,
and in a battle dangerously wounds a warrior.
This warrior is a woman, Zelinda herself. The lovers
recognize one another, embrace, and relate their adventures.
Alcidalis omits nothing except the episode
of the duchess, and shows himself as fond a lover as at
starting: "Were I racked to ten thousand pieces, as
every part of a broken mirrour presents an entire face,
in every part of Alcidalis would appear the bright
image of my adored Zelinda." At length they are
married; the couple recline at their banquet of love,
"and if no other pen raises them, they shall lye there
till Doomsday."</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Thus in two different ways a reaction showed itself
against the literature in fashion, and the merits of those
who attempted it only made its failure the more felt.
The caricature of the heroic romance and the attempt
at the novel of common life were without effect. Their
authors had come too soon, and remained isolated; the
false heroism now scoffed at in France continued in
England until the eighteenth century. The writers
under Queen Anne, in order to destroy it, were obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
to recommence the whole campaign. Addison, as we
have seen, found heroism still in fashion, and the great
romances in their places in ladies' libraries. They were
still being reprinted. There is, for example, an English
edition of "Cassandra" dated 1725, and one of
"Cleopatra" dated 1731. Fielding saw heroism still
in possession of the stage, and he satirized it in his
amusing "Tom Thumb." Carey attacked it in his
"Chrononotontologos."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The hundred years which follow Shakespeare's
death are, therefore, taken altogether, a period of little
invention and progress for romance literature. The
only new development it takes, consists in the
exaggeration of the heroic element, of which there was
enough already in many an Elizabethan novel; it
consists, in fact, in the magnifying of a defect. The
imitation of France only resulted in absurd productions
which were so successful and filled the literary stage so
entirely that they left no space for other kinds of
romances. In vain did a few intelligent persons, such as
the authors of "The Adventures of Covent Garden"
and of "Zelinda," attempt to bring about a reaction;
their words found no echo. The other kinds of novels
started in Shakespearean times continued to be cultivated,
but were not improved. The picaresque
romance as Nash had understood it, includes in the
seventeenth century no original specimen but Richard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Head's "English Rogue,"<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> one of the worst compositions
in this style to be found in any literature. The
allegorical, social, and political novel, as inaugurated
by Sir Thomas More, continued by Bacon, by Joseph
Hall, Bishop of Norwich, and by Godwin,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> that novel
which was to gain new life in the hands of Swift and
Johnson, is, if we except Bunyan's eloquent manual of
devotion, mainly represented in the second half of the
century by barren allegories, such as Harrington's
"Oceana," 1656, and Ingelow's "Bentivolio and
Urania," 1660; or by short stories like "The perplex'd
Prince," "The Court Secret," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> When we have read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
ten pages of these it is difficult to speak of them with
coolness and without an aggressive animosity towards
their authors.</p>

<p>Persistent and close analysis of human emotion and
of the passion of love in the way in which Sir Philip
Sidney had caught sight of it, disappeared from the novel
until the day when a second "Pamela" was to figure on
the literary stage, and to fill with emotion all London
and Paris, down even to Cr&eacute;billon fils, who was to write
to Lord Chesterfield: "Without 'Pamela' we should
not know what to read or to say." And at reading it,
the author of "The Sopha" was "moved to tears."</p>

<p>One work alone was published towards the end of
the century in which an original thought is to be
found, the "Oroonoko"<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> of Mrs. Behn. The sentiment
that animates it is of another epoch, and
belongs to a quite peculiar class of novel; with her
begins the philosophical novel, crowded with dissertations
on the world and humanity, on the vanity
of religions, the innocence of negroes, and the purity
of savages. These are the ideas of Rousseau before
Rousseau: other ideas of Rousseau had been, as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
have seen, anticipated, in the history of the novel, by
Lyly.</p>

<p>Remains of the ordinary heroic style are of course
not wanting. Being love-struck Oroonoko, an African
negro, well read in the classics, refuses to fight, and
following Achilles' example, retires to his tent. "For
the world, said he, it was a trifle not worth his care.
Go, continued he, sighing, and divide it amongst you,
and reap with joy what you so vainly prize!" In trying
to carry out this advice his companions are utterly
routed, until after two days Oroonoko consents to
take up his arms again, and the victors are at once all
put to flight. Oroonoko's death is also in the heroical
style, but a peculiar sort of heroism which recalls
Scud&eacute;ry, and at the same time Fenimore Cooper.</p>

<p>But more striking are the parts in which the manners
of the savages are compared to those of civilized
nations. "Everything is well," Rousseau was to say
later, "when it comes fresh from the hands of the
Maker of things; everything degenerates in the hands
of man."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Mrs. Behn expressed many years before
the very same ideas; her Oroonoko has been educated
by a Frenchman who "was a man of very little religion,
yet he had admirable morals and a brave soul," an
ancestor obviously of Rousseau himself, and a fit tutor
for this black "Emile." The aborigines of Surinam
live in a state of perfection which reminds Mrs. Behn
of Adam and Eve before the fall: "These people
represented to me an absolute idea of the first state
of innocence, before man knew how to sin: and 'tis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
most evident and plain that single nature is the most
harmless, inoffensive and virtuous mistress. 'Tis she
alone, if she were permitted, that better instructs the
world than all the inventions of man. Religion would
here but destroy that tranquillity they possess by
ignorance, and laws would but teach 'em to know
offences of which now they have no notion. They
made once mourning and fasting for the death of the
English governor who had given his hand to come on
such a day to 'em and neither came nor sent; believing
when a man's word is past, nothing but death could or
should prevent his keeping it."</p>

<p>The words "humanity," "mankind," are repeated
also with a frequency worthy of Rousseau, and the
religion of humanity is set in opposition to the religion
of God with a clearness foreshadowing the theories of
Auguste Comte. When the sea captain refuses to take
the word of Oroonoko as a pledge equivalent to his
own, "which if he should violate, he must expect
eternal torments in the world to come,"&mdash;"Is that all
the obligations he has to be just to his oath? replyed
Oroonoko. Let him know, I swear by my honour;
which to violate, would not only render me contemptible
and despised by all brave and honest men, and so give
me perpetual pain, but it would be eternally offending
and displeasing to all mankind, harming, betraying, circumventing
and outraging all men."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Most of these ideas, including an embryo-taste for
landscape painting, were to be cherished and eloquently
defended by Rousseau. Mrs. Behn, as a novelist, can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
only be studied with the authors of the middle of the
eighteenth century; she carries us at once beyond the
times of Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding, and takes
us among the precursors of the French Revolution.
With the change she foreshadows, philosophy and social
science are perhaps more concerned than the novel
proper.</p>

<p>It can, all things considered, be stated with truth that,
between the age of Elizabeth, and the age of Anne and
the Georges, there is in the history of the novel a long
period of semi-stagnation. The seventeenth century,
which furnishes hardly any important name, added
very little, apart from an exaggerated heroism, to the
art of the novel. Defoe, Richardson and Fielding are,
as novelists, more nearly related to the men of the time
of Shakespeare than to the men of the time of Dryden.
They have been thus so completely separated from their
literary ancestors that the connection has been usually
forgotten. It cannot, however, be doubted.</p>

<p>Now that we have carried so far this sketch of the
history of the early English novel, as far indeed as the
time of writers whose works are still our daily reading,
we have to take leave of our heroes, picaroons, and
monsters, of Arthur and Lancelot, Euphues and
Menaphon, Pyrocles and Rosalind, Jack Wilton and
Peregrine, Oroontades and Parthenissa; nor let us forget
to include in this farewell our Lamias, Mantichoras,
dragons, and all the menagerie of Topsell and of Lyly.
Mummified, buried and forgotten as most of these
romances have long been, they managed somehow not
to die childless, but left behind them the seed of better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
things. "No, those days are gone away," says Keats,
thinking of the legends of early times,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And their hours are old and grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their minutes buried all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the down trodden pall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the leaves of many years....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone, the merry morris din;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone, the song of Gamelyn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone, the tough-belted outlaw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All are gone away and past."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With them many reputations are gone. White fingers
circled with gold no longer turn over the pages of
"Euphues" or "Arcadia." But the writings of the
descendants of Greene and Nash and Sidney afford
endless delight to-day. And that is why these old
authors deserve not the lip-tribute of cold respect, but
the heart's offering of warmest gratitude; for they have
had the most numerous and the most brilliant posterity,
perhaps the most loved, that literary initiators have
ever had in any time or country.</p>

continuation. The translator is at some pains to anglicize his
original; when Scarron speaks of Paris, the translator puts
London; Ragotin is heard defending Spenser (chapter xv.). The
poet in Scarron brags of his acquaintance with Corneille and Rotrou,
and in the English text, with Shakespeare, Fletcher, and Jonson
(chap. viii.). There were other translations of Scarron: "The
whole comical works of M. Scarron," translated by Mr. T. Brown,
Mr. Savage, and others, London, 1700, 8vo; "The comic
romance," translated by O. Goldsmith, Dublin, 1780(?) 2 vol.

John Davies, who states in the preface of "The unexpected Choice,"
London, 1670, that he did so at the suggestion of the late Catherine
Philips, the matchless Orinda.</p></div>

1600, and appeared some years later on the continent, without
date. "The Man in the Moon or a discourse of a voyage thither,"
by F. Godwin, appeared in 1638, and was translated into French,
which allowed Cyrano de Bergerac to become acquainted with it:
"L'Homme dans la Lune ou le voyage chim&eacute;rique fait au monde
de la Lune" ... by Dominique Gonzal&egrave;s (pseud.), Paris, 1648,
8vo. The translation is by that same Baudoin who had already

is Wales; Otenia, England; Bogland, Scotland; the amours of
Charles II. and those of the Duke of York (the Prince of Purdino)
are related in it under fictitious names. "The Court Secret,"
1689; Selim I. and Selim II. represent Charles I. and Charles II.;
Cha-abas, Louis XIV., &amp;c. In "Oceana," Parthenia is Queen
Elizabeth; Morpheus, James I.; in Ingelow's work, Bentivolio
represents "Good will," and Urania "Heavenly light." "Oceana"
and "Bentivolio" are didactic treatises rather than romances;
the first is a political treatise, and the second a religious treatise,
an enormous morality in prose. "The Pilgrim's Progress" must
be placed among religious literature properly so-called, as being
its master-work in England.</p></div>

<h2>WORKS BY JOSEPH CONRAD</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<h1>AN OUTCAST OF THE
ISLANDS</h1>

<p class='center'><i>Crown 8vo</i>, <i>cloth</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p class='smaller'>"Subject to the qualifications thus disposed of (<i>vide</i> first part of notice),
'An Outcast of the Islands' is perhaps the finest piece of fiction that has been
published this year, as 'Almayer's Folly' was one of the finest that was published
in 1895 ... Surely this is real romance&mdash;the romance that is real.
Space forbids anything but the merest recapitulation of the other living
realities of Mr. Conrad's invention&mdash;of Lingard, of the inimitable Almayer,
the one-eyed Babalatchi, the Naturalist, of the pious Abdulla&mdash;all novel, all
authentic. Enough has been written to show Mr. Conrad's quality. He
imagines his scenes and their sequence like a master; he knows his individualities
and their hearts; he has a new and wonderful field in this East Indian
Novel of his.... Greatness is deliberately written; the present writer has
read and re-read his two books, and after putting this review aside for some
days to consider the discretion of it, the word still stands."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p></div>

<hr style='width: 35%;' />

<h3>II.</h3>

<h1>ALMAYER'S FOLLY</h1>

<p class='center'><i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>


<p class='center'><b>"This startling, unique, splendid book."</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. <span class="smcap">T. P. O'Connor</span>, M.P.</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p class='smaller'>"This is a decidedly powerful story of an uncommon type, and breaks fresh
ground in fiction.... All the leading characters in the book&mdash;Almayer, his
wife, his daughter, and Dain, the daughter's native lover&mdash;are well drawn, and
the parting between father and daughter has a pathetic naturalness about it,
unspoiled by straining after effect. There are, too, some admirably graphic
passages in the book. The approach of a monsoon is most effectively
described.... The name of Mr. Joseph Conrad is new to us, but it appears
to us as if he might become the Kipling of the Malay Archipelago."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p></div>

<hr style='width: 35%;' />

<h1>THE EBBING OF THE TIDE</h1>

<h3>BY</h3>

<h2>LOUIS BECKE</h2>

<p class='center'>Author of "By Reef and Palm"</p>

<p class='center'><i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p class='smaller'>"Mr. Louis Becke wields a powerful pen, with the additional advantage
that he waves it in unfrequented places, and summons up with it the elemental
passions of human nature.... It will be seen that Mr. Becke is somewhat
of the fleshly school, but with a pathos and power not given to the ordinary
professors of that school.... Altogether for those who like stirring stories
cast in strange scenes, this is a book to be read."&mdash;<i>National Observer.</i></p></div>

<hr style='width: 35%;' />

<h1>PACIFIC TALES</h1>

<h3>BY</h3>

<h2>LOUIS BECKE</h2>

<p class='center'>With a Portrait of the Author</p>

<p class='center'><i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p class='smaller'>"The appearance of a new book by Mr. Becke has become an event of note&mdash;and
very justly. No living author, if we except Mr. Kipling, has so amazing
a command of that unhackneyed vitality of phrase that most people call by
the name of realism. Whether it is scenery or character or incident that he
wishes to depict, the touch is ever so dramatic and vivid that the reader is
conscious of a picture and impression that has no parallel save in the records
of actual sight and memory."&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p class='smaller'>"Another series of sketches of island life in the South Seas, not inferior to
those contained in 'By Reef and Palm.'"&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<p class='smaller'>"The book is well worth reading. The author knows what he is talking

<div class="blockquot2"><p class='smaller'>"The writer who goes by the name of Mark Rutherford
is not the most popular novelist of his time by any means.
There are writers with names which that recluse genius
has never heard of, probably, whose stories give palpitations
to thousands of gentle souls, while his own are
quietly read by no more than as many hundreds. Yet his
publisher never announces a new story by the Author of
'Mark Rutherford's Autobiography,' and 'The Revolution
in Tanner's Lane,'&mdash;which we believe to be one of the
most remarkable bits of writing that these times can boast
of&mdash;without strongly exciting the interest of many who
know books as precious stones are known in Hatton
Garden.... 'Clara Hopgood' is entirely out of the
way of all existing schools of novel-writing.... Had
we to select a good illustration of 'Mark's way' as distinguished
from the way of modern storytellers in general,
we should point to the chapter in which Baruch visits his
son Benjamin in this narration. Nothing could be more
simple, nothing more perfect."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p></div>
